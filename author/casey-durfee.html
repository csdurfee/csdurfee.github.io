<p>Last time, we found that there are many players like LeBron, where their FG% is higher when they've missed most of their last 5 shots than when they've made most of them. However, most players don't have enough attempts when they've gone 0 or 5 out of their last 5</p>
<p>For this analysis, I will be looking at a binary split -- I will call a player <em>cold</em> when they've made 0, 1 or 2 of their last 5 shots, and <em>hot</em> when they've made 3, 4 or 5 of their last 5. Most players have a FG% between 40 and 60%, so this nicely splits them into shooting better than average or worse than average.</p>
<h2>Anthony Edwards</h2>
<p>Anthony Edwards ("Ant") is particularly unstreaky for a young player. He's only completed 5 seasons in the league, but has the 5th biggest z score of the last 20 years. He could definitely catch LeBron someday.</p>
<p>Ant has the LeBron-like pattern of FG% trending downward when he's <em>hot</em>. He doesn't have anywhere near the volume of LeBron, so the spike at 20% (1/5) might just be noise. But overall, he shoots worse when he's been shooting well.</p>
<p><img alt="ant-last-5" src="/img/ant-last-5.png"></p>
<p>The trend appears to be due to shot selection. He takes far more above the break 3 pointers when he's <em>hot</em> than when he's cold. The additional 3 point attempts come at the expense of shots in the restricted area.</p>
<p>Here are the changes in tendencies:</p>

<p>Of course, this would be justified if Ant shot above the break 3's better when he's <em>hot</em>, but he doesn't. He makes 37% of his above the break 3's when he's <em>cold</em> but that drops to 34% when he's hot. So he's trading restricted area shots, with an expected value of .601 * 2 = 1.202 points, for above the break 3's, with an expected value of .34 * 3 = 1.02 points.</p>
<p>Here are the changes in FG percentages. His FG% on corner 3's goes up, but it's on insignificant volume:</p>

<h2>The rest of the league</h2>
<p>I looked at league-wide shot selection in <em>hot</em>/<em>cold</em> situations. I restricted to the last 10 seasons, since the rise of the 3 pointer has dramatically changed shot selection. Here are changes in shot selection for all players:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;">BASIC_ZONE</th>
<th style="text-align: right;">hot</th>
<th style="text-align: right;">cold</th>

<td style="text-align: left;">In The Paint (Non-RA)</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">15.8</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">15.3</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">0.4</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Mid-Range</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">25.3</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">23.5</td>

<td style="text-align: right;">-1.2</td>

</table>
<p>The mid-range shot is the lowest value shot type, so it's notable that the rate goes up when players are <em>hot</em>. These additional mid ranges come at the expense of Corner 3's and Restricted Area shots, the two most valuable types of shots.</p>
<p>As before, changes in shot selection could be justified if players actually shoot differently based on their last 5 results, but they don't. Here are the changes in shooting percentages (hot minus cold) for all players:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;">BASIC_ZONE</th>
<th style="text-align: right;">hot</th>
<th style="text-align: right;">cold</th>
<th style="text-align: right;">diff</th>

</thead>
<tbody>

<td style="text-align: left;">Above the Break 3</td>

<td style="text-align: right;">35</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">-0.3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Corner 3</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">38.4</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">38.9</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">-0.4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">In The Paint (Non-RA)</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">41.7</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">41.2</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">0.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Mid-Range</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">39.8</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">40.1</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">-0.3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Restricted Area</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">62.7</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">60.7</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For 3 out of 5 shot types, the <em>hot</em> FG percentages are lower than the <em>cold</em> ones. Combined with the changes in shot selection, I think there's evidence that the league as a whole is scoring less efficiently because of the false belief in the hot hand. </p>
<p>The data says that players are essentially trading Restricted Area (.627 * 2 = 1.25 points per shot) and Corner 3 (.384 * 3 = 1.15 points per shot) attempts for Mid-Ranges (.398 * 2 = .796 points per shot) when they think they've got the <em>hot hand</em>. That's clearly bad! If it happens once a game, that's 38 points a year lost, which might be enough to swing a game or two.</p>
<p>The change in restricted area and in the paint (non-RA) FG% is intriguing, but if the hot hand did exist, wouldn't we see it on 3 point or mid-range shots, rather than restricted area shots? The announcer doesn't say "he's heating up" after a guy has made 3 layups in a row, they say it after 3 longer range shots in a row, right?</p>
<h2>Higher volume players</h2>
<p>I decided to focus on players with at least 1000 streaks, which leaves 630 players. Collectively, they are responsible for 84% of all shots in the NBA over the last 20 years.</p>
<p>Their FG percentages are, on average, 1% lower when they are <em>hot</em> than when they are <em>cold</em>. </p>
<p>68% of them shoot worse when they're hot than when they're cold, which is a pretty dramatic split.</p>
<p><img alt="fg-pct-hot-cold" src="/img/fg-pct-hot-cold.png"></p>
<p>Here's a plot of the difference between hot and cold FG% versus z-score:</p>
<p><img alt="z-score-hot-cold" src="/img/z-score-hot-cold.png"></p>
<p>Players with negative values on the x axis shoot better when they're cold, and positive values shoot better when they're hot.</p>
<p>Now, there should be some correlation between z-scores and hot/cold shooting tendency. I've shown simulations where a tendency to shoot <em>better cold</em> produces unstreaky results (skewed towards positive z scores), and <em>better hot</em> will produce streaky results (negative z scores). So there should be more dots in the upper left and bottom right quadrants compared to the other diagonal.</p>
<p>But if players behaved by coin flips, we should see roughly the same number of players with positive and negative z scores, and roughly the same number of players who shoot better when they're hot and better when they're cold.</p>
<p>I simulated all 3.5 million shots by these players, using their career average FG% for every shot. So any streakiness or unstreakiness is going to be totally random.</p>
<p><img alt="sim-z-hot-cold" src="/img/sim-z-hot-cold.png"></p>
<p>Here are the crosstabs from the simulation:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>better cold</th>
<th>better hot</th>
<th>margin</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>positive z</td>
<td>178</td>
<td>135</td>
<td>313</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>negative z</td>
<td>112</td>
<td>210</td>
<td>322</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>margin</td>
<td>290</td>
<td>345</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As promised, the marginal values are pretty close to one another. That's what happens when "better hot" vs. "better cold" and "positive z" vs. "negative z" are determined purely by chance.</p>
<p>Here are the actual crosstabs:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>better cold</th>
<th>better hot</th>
<th>margin</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>positive z</td>
<td>343</td>
<td>126</td>
<td>469</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>negative z</td>
<td>88</td>
<td>78</td>
<td>166</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>margin</td>
<td>431</td>
<td>204</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>68% of the players shoot better when they're cold.</li>
<li>74% of the players have a positive z-score.</li>
<li>Even among players with a negative z score, the majority of them shoot better when they're cold. </li>
<li>Even among players that shoot better when they're hot, the majority of them <em>still</em> produce results that are less streaky than expected by chance.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all super weird!</p>
<p>As always, these are just general trends. There are 78 players in the "better hot" + "negative z" box, and there should be around 210 players. We can't really say which players are the 130 "missing" players, though.</p>
<p>That's all I've got on the hot hand in the NBA for now. I think I understand it a lot better now, and I hope you do, too. </p>                    </article>
