&lt;h1&gt;Even the experts can't do it&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I've been chronicling in the &lt;a href="/tag/bajillion.html"&gt;"Bajillion"&lt;/a&gt; segment, experts are really bad at betting on NFL football, or at least the ones at the Ringer are …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcGAbRISnr4" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Light-Space Modulator, &amp;quot;These Things&amp;quot;" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/dcGAbRISnr4/0.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Song: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcGAbRISnr4" target="_blank"&gt;Light-Space Modulator, "These Things"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notebook: &lt;a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/csdurfee.github.io/blob/main/notebooks/super-contest.ipynb"&gt;https://github.com/csdurfee/csdurfee.github.io/blob/main/notebooks/super-contest.ipynb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Even the experts can't do it&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I've been chronicling in the &lt;a href="/tag/bajillion.html"&gt;"Bajillion"&lt;/a&gt; segment, experts are really bad at betting on NFL football, or at least the ones at the Ringer are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That inspired me to make my first YouTube video, about sports gambling and why it's not really a game of skill. I'm still working on it, but I promised I'd do a thing a week on here. This is that thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ringer's football/gambling experts doing worse than a coin flip on the NFL could just be coincidence, bad luck, or as gamblers say, a &lt;em&gt;bad beat&lt;/em&gt;. I figured I should make more of an effort to find real-world betting records on the NFL by people who have might skill as gamblers, rather than people who talk about sports for a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.westgateresorts.com/hotels/nevada/las-vegas/westgate-las-vegas-resort-casino/casino/2025-supercontest-standings/"&gt;The Westgate Resorts (TM) Las Vegas Super Contest (R)&lt;/a&gt; seemed like the perfect testing ground. It's exactly like the Ringer 107, except there's cash on the line. With a buy-in of $1500 and around 1,000 teams a year, that's a pretty nice top prize. (There are fewer contestants this year than normal, maybe because the buy-in increased from $1,000.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the people at the Ringer are using their picks to generate interesting football content, these contestants have lot of financial incentive to do well and nobody they have to explain their picks to. The Ringer writers might have a bias against taking the uglier/harder to justify side of a bet, because their job is really to tell a story that people want to listen to. But these folks should be eating W's like crab legs and not caring how messy it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That $1500 buy in is 207 hours of wages, pre-tax, for someone making the federal minimum wage. For regular folks, $1500 is most of a mortgage payment, or a few months of groceries. Anyone risking that much money should have rational reasons to believe they're good at betting on football, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't a non-gambling football writer forced to make picks for the sake of content. The contestants consider themselves sharp enough to beat 1,000 other competitors in a pretty famous betting contest, for a Million dollar payout and the chance to get their photo taken with a bunch of showgirls while holding a giant novelty check. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;em&gt;kumite&lt;/em&gt; of football betting, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNZ1ElwD_JA"&gt;the ultimate contest of warriors&lt;/a&gt;, and I assume you're only going to enter the &lt;em&gt;kumite&lt;/em&gt; if you've won a few fights before.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind you, there are around 15 NFL games every week and the teams only have to pick 5 of them for the Super Contest. Maybe most lines are so fair nobody can make money betting them, but the contestants only need to take one game in three. If there are any lines that are beatable, these contestants should be finding them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My assumption before running the numbers was that this was a contest for people who should have a decent chance of at least breaking even (over 52.4% winning percentage.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The terrible, horrible, no good, very bad year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That hasn't been even close to true this season. Data as of week 16 taken from &lt;a href="https://www.westgateresorts.com/hotels/nevada/las-vegas/westgate-las-vegas-resort-casino/casino/2025-supercontest-standings/"&gt;the Westgate Resorts website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 751 entrants in the 2025 contest. 59% of them (444/751) have a losing record. 76% of them would be losing money, if they were taking their picks at -110 odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively, the teams have won 48.6% of their bets. It might not sound terrible, but there are 700+ teams who have taken 70 bets apiece, so it's a big sample size overall -- over 54,000 bets in total. Statistically, they're much worse than flipping a coin. If you flipped a coin 54,000 times and it came up heads 48.6% of the time, you'd be safe concluding it wasn't actually a fair coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's one way to visualize the suckitude. I simulated each team making picks by flipping a fair coin, and compared them to the actual results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/super-contest.png" src="/img/super-contest.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The white areas are where there were fewer real competitors than we'd expect by random chance, the dark blue parts are where there are more real competitors than expected, and the light blue is the overlap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The white vertical line is the minimum winning percent to break even at standard -110 odds. Most of the white area, where there are fewer competitors than expected, is to the right of the line, and all of the dark blue area is at less than 50% winning percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anti Skill and Uncle Juice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best entry in the contest is sitting at 53-21, the amusingly named &lt;code&gt;BIFFS ALMANAC&lt;/code&gt;. That record would be an outlier if we were selecting bets by chance, so even though it's a small sample size, kudos to them, and their mostly accurate sports almanac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst record belongs to the also amusingly named &lt;code&gt;THISSHOULDBEEASY&lt;/code&gt;, with a record of 24-49. If that team had just taken the opposite of their bets, they'd be in 2nd place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the teams would be doing better if they wrote down their best picks, then took the opposite of them. Knowing stuff sure seems to be a disadvantage when betting on football. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In aggregate, whatever strategies or football knowledge or divination rites (*) the contestants are using makes them worse at picking winners -- they possibly have &lt;em&gt;anti-skill&lt;/em&gt;. This is sort of what the efficient market hypothesis for the stock market predicts -- picking stocks randomly (or index funds, which invest in every stock on the market) will generally outperform mutual funds that have professional fund managers making the picks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(*) I'm a big tyromancy guy myself. RIP to the recently departed &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Lecouteux"&gt;Claude Lecouteux&lt;/a&gt;, a legendary historian of spooky medieval stuff. If you ever need to write a heavy metal concept album on short notice, his books are a goldmine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Previous years&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bunch of wasted work to screen-scrape results from previous years off 3rd party sites, I discovered &lt;a href="https://fantasysupercontest.com/supercontest-standings-2020-week-18"&gt;another website&lt;/a&gt; that has the complete records going back to 2013 in CSV format. Score!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This season has been particularly difficult on Super Contest gamblers, which probably explains the Ringer's poor record. Previous seasons have looked more like what I expected -- the average Super Contest entrant is a little better than flipping a coin, but not good enough to actually make money gambling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the Expected Values by year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/return-rate.png" src="/img/return-rate.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dotted line is at -4.5%, the Expected Value (EV) of taking a bet at -110 with a 50% chance of winning. There have been 5 seasons where the average competitor has done about the same as flipping a coin, or worse, and 2 seasons where they came close to breaking even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over all seasons and all contestants, the average EV is -2.5%, about the same as betting 'reduced juice' (-105 odds instead of -110) with a 50% chance of winning. Overall, the EV has been better than what we'd expect by chance, but not good enough to be profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the contestants only have to pick 5 games every week, this data should represent the best case scenario -- the most beatable lines possible, being taken by more experienced than average gamblers -- and they're still losing money 11/13 years, and breaking even the other two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the 75th percentile has a decent rate of return (up until this season), that's true of flipping a coin as well. With fewer than 100 bets in a Super Contest season, it's very possible to have a winning record by chance alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The win rate of competitors has been going down for 3 years in a row. It may be due to weaker competition in the Super Contest, or just random variation, but I would guess it's at least partially due to better lines. More money than ever is being gambled, and there's more information than ever, so the lines should get tighter. I would have to pull a lot more data to answer that question, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking for other experts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, maybe that's still not enough proof -- what about people who make a living selling their supposed gambling expertise? I've looked at a ton of sites that sell picks for money, so I have an idea how this will go. But I came across a new one that's run by some pretty smart folks, so let's give it a crack, and I'll try to act suprised at the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site in question is called &lt;a href="https://ftnfantasy.com/bets/nfl/bet-tracker"&gt;FTN Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;. It's affiliated with Aaron Schatz, who I'm pretty sure basically invented modern football analytics with his site Football Outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DVOA, ever heard of it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If football betting is a game of skill, a game of &lt;em&gt;ball-knowing&lt;/em&gt; (at least the stats version of ball-knowing), he should have that skill. Here's Aaron's record:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/just-aaron.png" src="/img/just-aaron.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no! He's got a losing record overall, a -11% EV on his bets (vs. -4.5% for picking which mascot would win in a fight). Who could have seen that coming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the whole site's record:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/ftn-fantasy.png" src="/img/ftn-fantasy.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they have a winning record overall, they have a losing record against the spread (the bets labeled &lt;code&gt;Sides&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Giving them props&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prop bets are, well, propping their record up. Since the site is primarily about fantasy football, it makes sense they would be strong on prop bets, since fantasy is all about individual player predictions. That makes them a cut above most tout sites, who aren't good at anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's quite possible that prop bets are beatable in a way spread bets aren't, though as discussed in the video, the big sportsbooks no longer allow taking the unders on prop bets, which I'm sure makes it harder to find value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My caveat about tips on prop bets is that the lines tend to move very rapidly, and in large amounts. A line could very quickly go from positive to negative Expected Value before someone could get a bet down. So the tips might be legit, but not be &lt;em&gt;usable&lt;/em&gt; to the gambler paying for them -- they have a very short shelf life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Touts and their tricks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only tout with a good record against the spread is esteemed actor Michael Chiklis apparently doing a little moonlighting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/the-commish.png" src="/img/the-commish.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commish is doing something I've seen a lot of touts do, which is taking some games at higher than -110 odds in order to make the win-loss record appear better (for example, buying a couple of points and taking -150 odds, which should win significantly more than 50% of the time). The equivalent record at -110 odds would be 41-35, only a 54% winning percentage. That's better than nothin', but it ain't much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm inclined to be distrustful of any tout pulling that trick, since buying points is a negative Expected Value play. (We don't need math for this one: the sportsbooks wouldn't offer the option of buying points if it was positive EV for the gambler. They're counting on the gambler making an emotional decision to buy the points, because they've done the math and know it's a bad deal.) Buying points might make the record look better, but it will hurt profits/increase losses over the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bajillion, Week bajillion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One mathletix team picks bets randomly, the other algorithmically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ringer had another losing week, going 12-13 overall, despite one team going 5-0.  Mathletix went 6-3 on the week, despite a couple of &lt;em&gt;bad beats&lt;/em&gt; (bets that just barely lost).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Two Georges, damn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the NBA right now, there are two up-and-coming players with very similar names. This seems to keep happening in the league. I wish somebody would do something about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a few years now, we've had to deal with …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv0UiQ5n7SM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;Pacific State (12&amp;quot; version)&amp;quot;, 808 State" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/Tv0UiQ5n7SM/0.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Song: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv0UiQ5n7SM" target="_blank"&gt;"Pacific State (12" version)", 808 State&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Georges, damn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the NBA right now, there are two up-and-coming players with very similar names. This seems to keep happening in the league. I wish somebody would do something about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a few years now, we've had to deal with two players named Jaylin Williams and Jalen Williams who play on the same team and have similarly generic nicknames, forcing hoops fans to remember which one is "J Dub" and which is "Jay Will". This is on top of a dozen other "Jalens" playing for other teams as well. (Do Jalen Rose or his parents get any residuals for all these basketball Jalenses? I hope so.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compounding the problem for Keyonte George of the Utah Jazz and Kyshawn George of the Washington Wizards is the fact they play for two of the worst teams in the league. There's only so much Jazz/Wizards basketball anyone can watch and stay sane, so even avid hoops fans should be forgiven for doing a "Christian Bale"/"Kirsten Bell" thing with them. Even pro sports journalists do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POcuiqRTbnM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;Kristianne Baille&amp;quot; by Trevor Clarence on Youtube" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/POcuiqRTbnM/0.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both started out looking like they were drowning in the NBA, but they're putting it together, Kyshawn in his second season, Keyonte in his third, so it's time to tune in while you can still say you knew about them before it was cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kyshawn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyshawn George is a floofy haired youth who always looks like he's 15 minutes late to his Political Science class. He should probably be playing in a North Face puffy jacket and pajama pants instead of a Wizards uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/kyshawn.jpg" src="/img/kyshawn.jpg"&gt;
All-Pro Reels, CC BY-SA 4.0 &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0"&gt;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0&lt;/a&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the big hair and the throwback Wizards jersey, he looks a little bit like greatest player in Washington Bullets/Wizards history, Wes Unseld:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/wes-unseld.jpg" src="/img/wes-unseld.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His game is a little Unseld-y, too. Unseld was a 6'7" guy who played center. Guarding much bigger players takes a certain quality -- solidness -- that not all players have. Some guys just occupy space better than others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although he plays small forward, Kyshawn George has that solidness. At his best, Kyshawn just kind of owns the floor, unafraid to bounce off of other players (or go through them) in order to score or get the rebound. And like Unseld, he has good passing skills. If Wes Unseld played today, he might be a point forward like Kyshawn, who is leading the Wizards in assists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At his worst, well, Kyshawn's got a lot to learn. I think he has the capability to be a very good defender, but the Wizards are just awful at defense -- worst in the league by points allowed. It's hard for me to tell how good a player is when they're surrounded by teammates who make lots of defensive mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keyonte&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keyonte George, looks a bit like, I dunno, Timon from the Lion King. I don't have Timon's scouting report, but Keyonte's a super quick modern point guard who can score as well as set his teammates up. Or at least that was the idea. His first two years in the league were disappointing. He mostly shot 3 pointers, and wasn't especially good at it. As a point guard, he was tentative, and seemed to check out mentally at times when things were going bad (a frequent occurence on the woeful Jazz.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, he's more of an all-around scorer, and much more efficient. He's scoring almost 6 more points per 36 minutes, while only taking 1.7 more shot attempts. A lot of that is driven by getting more free throws -- 3 more made free throws per 36 over last season. He's a threat to score from just about everywhere, after two seasons of not being a threat anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keyonte's still bad on defense. The Jazz are 28th in Defensive Rating, so like Kyshawn, it's awfully hard to say how good he really is when he plays on such a crappy team. His game is similar to DeAaron Fox, who is currently thriving on the Spurs surrounded by significantly above average defenders. So I think he has a bright future even if he never makes a big leap on defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7'6" man kills giant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shout out to the try-hard Spurs for taking down the Thunder in the NBA cup. The fact that the tallest guy in the NBA took down basketball Goliath is perfect. No notes. My biggest basketball fear is that if the aliens come down and challenge Earth to a game, we're not gonna have anyone who can guard Wemby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mathletix Bajillion, week I guess we're still doing this&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, one of these teams picks randomly, the other algorithmically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ringer went 9-16 on the week, for a 171-204 combined record on the season and 45.6% winning percentage. The mathletix teams didn't cover themselves in glory either, going 3-7. Nobody knows nothin'. All of us are in the gutter, but some of us are staring at the reduced juice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Bucks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of buzz around the Milwaukee Bucks right now because their star player has asked to be traded, but I'm gonna stick to the math. The NBA take-industrial complex has got the Giannis situation covered, and I do math better than drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noted a few weeks ago that the Bucks make a surprisingly low number of free throws given that they have a guy with one of the highest free throw rates in the league. They're also bad on defense and end up fouling a lot. That's a bad combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of December 5th, the Bucks are dead last in free throws made (14.4 per game) and 6th worst in free throws made by the other team (21.3 per game). Aren't they essentially having to play every game with a 6.9 point handicap? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it's an intuitively simple way of looking at things, it's too simple. Basketball strategy is a series of tradeoffs. There are a lot of "good" numbers -- stats that correlate with more wins -- but it's usually hard to make one &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; number go up without a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; number going up, or another &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; number going down, in response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking at the last 25 years of team data from nba.com/stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things to remember about free throws&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are complications to analyzing free throws because they're not a fixed quantity. Some fans will see a game where one team gets 20 free throws and the other team gets 35, and take it as evidence that the refs were biased. That's naive -- some players/teams foul more on defense, some players/teams take more &lt;em&gt;foul-worthy&lt;/em&gt; shots on on offense, and there's plenty of random variation form game to game. It would be weird if every team committed exactly 30 fouls every single game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's seasonality to foul calls as well. On top of formal rule changes, the NBA issues &lt;em&gt;points of emphasis&lt;/em&gt; for its officials each year, which change how the rules are interpreted. Certain types of fouls may be emphasized, or de-emphasized, causing the total number of fouls called to go up or down. It's hard to find a formal record of these de facto rule changes, but as a fan, I've seen it several times. For instance, &lt;a href="/overs-money-lines-and-pigeonholes.html"&gt;I previously talked about&lt;/a&gt; the middle of the 2023 season, where the league told officials to stop calling so many fouls in general, without telling teams or the general public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was another shift in the early 2010's where the officials quit calling so many fouls caused by the actions of the shooter rather than the defender. A shooter can shoot in a somewhat artificial way to ensnare the defender's arms. This type of grifting still exists in the league -- looking at you, James Harden -- but the league reduced the number of cheap fouls called in the early 2010's. I couldn't find exactly when they formally made the proclamation, but we can see a big shift in the free throw data after the 2010-11 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/made-ft.png" src="/img/made-ft.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current season has been more like the NBA from 2004-2010, at over 39 made free throws a game. However, there's a lot more scoring now, so free throws are a smaller percentage of a team's total points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/points-off-ft.png" src="/img/points-off-ft.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do free throw differentials matter?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there's going to be a lot more variance in the 20 games of this season when compared to a full 82 games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bucks' free throw differential of -6.9 (&lt;em&gt;not nice&lt;/em&gt;) would be by far the worst of the last 25 years, if it held for the whole season. The Celtics' current differential of -6.3 also stands out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;90% of NBA seasons are between the two white lines. We'd expect there to be 3 outliers by the end of the season, instead of 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/ft-diff-season.png" src="/img/ft-diff-season.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the differential is due to chance. We should charitably assume that referees make random errors when calling or not calling fouls. Refs can make both Type I errors (fouls they shouldn't have called) and Type II errors (fouls they should have called and missed). Some teams will get called for more fouls than other teams, due to randomness, rather than conspiracy. Over a larger sample size, the refereeing luck will even out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free throw differential is positively correlated with winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/ftm-diff-win-pct.png" src="/img/ftm-diff-win-pct.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagonal line is the overall trendline. Even though it's a positive trend, the teams with some of the biggest positive and negative differentials are close to .500 win percentage. This is a good example of why it's important to visualize data, not just look at the correlation. The bigger picture shows it's good to have a positive free throw point differential, but not a magic ticket to winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do referees try to keep fouls roughly even?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible referees have an unconscious bias towards calling an even number of fouls on both teams. There's certainly a correlation between more free throws made and more free throws given up to the other team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/ftm-vs-opponent.png" src="/img/ftm-vs-opponent.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this overall picture is misleading. The number of fouls called per game goes up and down season-to-season based on rule changes and &lt;em&gt;points of emphasis&lt;/em&gt;. So from year to year, the center of all the dots should move up and down along the diagonal line &lt;code&gt;FTM=Opponent FTM&lt;/code&gt;. We should expect a positive correlation overall that isn't necessarily there in the individual seasons -- an example of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_paradox"&gt;Simpson's paradox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an animation of the correlations year-by-year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/ftm-scatter.gif" src="/img/ftm-scatter.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of seasons, the trendline is basically flat. But plotting correlations year by year, there are a lot more positive years than negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/corr-ftm.png" src="/img/corr-ftm.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I do think it's possible that refs call more fouls on teams that get fouled a lot, a conscious or subconscious bias towards &lt;em&gt;fairness&lt;/em&gt;. Or perhaps, teams that play physical on offense also tend to play physical on defense as well. We'd need to look at individual games -- we're not going to see evidence of that in the yearly averages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basketball strategy and opportunity cost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opponent's number of free throws made has a higher correlation with winning percentage (&lt;code&gt;r=-0.260&lt;/code&gt;) than a team's number of free throws made (&lt;code&gt;r=0.153&lt;/code&gt;). If it were possible to make such a binary tradeoff, the Bucks would be better off trying to foul the other team less, rather than trying to draw more fouls. That's especially true given the Bucks are the best 3 point shooting team in the league -- drawing more fouls would mean fewer 3 point attempts. They have the 2nd highest eFG%, so they're already making the most of their shot attempts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why isn't their offense better overall? One big reason is their offensive rebounding rate is the lowest in the league. They score the fewest 2nd chance points in the league, at only 10.5 2nd chance points a game, versus 18 a game for the top teams. Does that mean another de facto 7 point handicap?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily, because offensive rebounding rate is a schematic choice. Do the bigs try to get the rebound (&lt;em&gt;crash the boards&lt;/em&gt;), or do they try to hustle back and play defense? Teams coached by Doc Rivers tend to have low offensive rebounding rates. The "Lob City" Clippers were a great rebounding team, yet in their heyday from 2014-2018, they were 21st, 28th, 29th, and 24th in offensive rebounding, so it's not surprising the Bucks have that same tendency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thunder have the 3rd fewest second chance points, so a team can definitely be elite and not get a lot of offensive rebounds. But unlike the Thunder, the Bucks are bad on defense (22nd in defensive rating) and foul way too much, so they're not in a good place to make defense their identity. If this were NBA 2K, I'd probably move the "crash the boards" slider to the left for the Bucks and see what happens, because the Bucks are closer to being elite on the offensive end. There's more strength to build on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only a very slight positive correlation between 2nd chance point differential and winning percentage. It's a bad predictor of team success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/2nd-chance-diff.png" src="/img/2nd-chance-diff.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Nets are fun... for now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brooklyn Nets had a bunch of draft picks and cap space going into this offseason, and they didn't seem to maximize those resources. A lot of people didn't like the trade they made for Michael Porter Jr., which got the Denver Nuggets out of salary cap hell in exchange for a fairly small return. The Nets were the only team in the league with the financial flexibility to take on bad contracts in trades, so they probably could have gotten more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also didn't trade any of the five first round picks they accumulated in this year's draft. Why didn't they trade some of them for future picks? The conventional wisdom is that teams shouldn't try to develop too many rookies at once. What's a team supposed to do with five rookies (two of whom are teenagers), with some overlap in the positions they play?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well for one thing, they're supposed to be terrible. The Nets have been bottoming out for a few seasons, and I doubt that will stop this season. Catch them in the next few weeks while they're sort of trying to win games, if you're curious. They've won 3 out of their last 4 games and they've been entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were fun for a few weeks at this point in the season last year, too. The front office will probably try to trade away their best players over the next couple of months to keep them from being too good. But right now, MPJ is a good stats/bad team All-Star, Nic Claxton is solid as always, rookie Danny Wolf is already a fan favorite, and a couple other rookies show promise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As fun as they are, I'm not encouraged by the Nets' approach to rebuilding. I'm always a lot more concerned with process than outcomes, because the process can be controlled. It seems like their idea is that if they draft enough first rounders, inevitably some of them will be good. It's treating players like lotto scratch tickets -- players are inherently winners or losers, and it's the front office's job to play the percentages and get as many picks as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's bad process to me. Players are more like a packet of seeds. The final result is heavily dependent on how and where they are grown. The same seed grown in two different environments can give two very different results. Some seeds are better than others, but without the right environment, even the best seeds won't grow to their maximum potential. I don't know if they have the culture and support system to develop their five rookies. It will be a few years before we'll see what sort of trees they're growing in Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Mathletix Bajillion, week whatever&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, one set of NFL picks is algorithmic, the other is random. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathletix won the week, with a total record of 6-4 versus the Ringer's 10-15 record (note: their website incorrectly lists &lt;em&gt;The Handicapos&lt;/em&gt; as going 5-0 when they actually went 4-1. I'm petty enough to notice, but not petty enough to email them about it.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ringer currently has 3 teams at 33-37 and 2 teams at 31-39, for a cumulative record of 161-189 (46.0% winning rate). Of course, some of the Ringer's picks contradict each other -- one Ringer team taking the home team, and another taking the away team on the same game. Removing the bets where Ringer teams contradicted each other would just make things worse, though, because taking both sides of a bet has a winning percentage of 50%, which is better than the Ringer's overall win rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone taking the opposite of every one of the Ringer experts' picks would be up 11.9 units on the year, for a +3.4% rate of return. There's only a 6.7% chance of getting results that bad by flipping a coin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I've written about before, I don't think that makes them bad as far as gambling experts go. Rather, I believe everything they know about football has already been incorporated into the line, so their knowledge is kind of a curse -- they're overvaluing information that the market has already absorbed, so they end up losing more than 50% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Kings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sacramento Kings are going through it. Again. For most other teams, the choices they've made recently would be a historically incompetent period, a basketball Dark Ages. For the Kings, it's just another season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firing the only coach that's had success with the team in a long time and replacing him with a buddy of the owner who is willing to work cheap. Drafting two All-Star point guards and trading both of them away. Trading for two guys (LaVine and DeRozan) who everybody knew would be a bad fit from their years playing together on the Bulls. Trading the very good, ultra reliable Jonas Valančiūnas for the washed Dario Saric just to save a tiny bit of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKMMCPeiQoc"&gt;definition of insanity&lt;/a&gt;? The Kings' front office doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sacramento is 5-16 so far. They're definitely not a good team, but maybe they're &lt;em&gt;not that bad&lt;/em&gt;? They went 40-42 last season, which is respectable in the loaded Western Conference. They've had a brutally hard schedule, and 21 games is not a large sample size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll get back to the Kings, but first, the other side of the coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Heat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Miami Heat were arguably in a worse place than the Kings at the end of last season. They won 37 games, 3 fewer than the Kings, and play in the easier conference. They looked totally checked out by the end of the season, another team stuck in the middle of the NBA standings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a disappointing, dysfunctional run where they &lt;a href="/free-throw-merchants-and-the-value-of-stars.html"&gt;traded away their best player&lt;/a&gt; and seemed to be going nowhere. The vibes were bad, but they didn't blow up the team for the hope of maybe being good again someday, or run back the same players and the same scheme for another bout of mediocrity. Instead, they trusted the culture they built and tried something innovative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've been one of the best stories in the NBA so far, greatly outperforming expectations by playing a radical brand of basketball on the offensive end. They completely overhauled their offense to quickly attack one-on-one matchups before the defense can get set, rather than the traditional approach of creating mismatches using pick-and-rolls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVBsWm7uhGw"&gt;Here's a good video from Thinking Basketball explaining the strategy&lt;/a&gt;, an even more turbo-charged version of the scheme the Grizzlies used to great success last year. As a basketball fan, it's a bit weird to watch at first, because pick and rolls are such an traditional part of basketball, but it's refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know why more teams don't have the courage to try unconventional things  -- &lt;a href="/home-of-elvis-and-the-ancient-greeks.html"&gt;or in the Grizzlies' case, stick with something unconventional that was working.&lt;/a&gt; In the NBA, it takes a great coach and front office to defy the conventional wisdom and try to get more out of the players already on the roster -- putting them in a position to succeed rather than re-shuffling the deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most remarkable part is that overhauling the offense hasn't sacrificed the Heat's identity as a top-tier defensive team at all. They have the 4th best defense in the league so far by Defensive Rating. They're doing this while playing at the fastest pace in the league this year. Teams that play fast are usually just trying to outscore their opponents, with little attention to defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Heat are using their scheme to generate high quality offensive opportunities for players that are primarily on the court for their defense. They're building on their core identity rather than changing directions entirely. They're building on strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An elite playmaker like Tyrese Halliburton, or a generational talent like SGA or Jokic, can set up defense-first players for easy looks, but most teams that concentrate on defense struggle generating enough offensive firepower. The Orlando Magic have been plagued by that problem for years. The system Miami is running seems like a cheat code for defensively minded teams -- at least until the league inevitably figures out ways to slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't find anybody in the media who knew the Heat's scheme change was coming, much less an idea of how much of an impact it would have.  I looked at a bunch of preseason power rankings, and they were all pretty down on the Heat for the same reasons, without any hint that they could fix the problems with a different play style. It's much easier to assess the impact of roster changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, this is from &lt;a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/nba-power-rankings-2025-26-where-do-teams-stand-after-nba-offseason-rockets-nuggets-chase-thunder-at-top"&gt;NBC Sports'&lt;/a&gt; preseason power rankings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this was a middle-of-the-pack Heat team last season that made no bold moves, no massive upgrades, leaving them in the same spot they were a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25253509-nba-power-rankings-entering-2025-preseason"&gt;Bleacher Report's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for an offensively challenged team, replacing [Tyler Herro's] scoring (21.5 points over the last four seasons) and distribution (4.6 assists in the same span) is going to be tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2025/09/30/nba-power-rankings-training-camps/86421865007/"&gt;USA Today's&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losing Tyler Herro for the first two months of the season, potentially, comes as a significant blow to a team that struggled to score — especially late in games — even when he was on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the change in style the Heat are still only a mid-tier team on offense, ranking 14th in Offensive Rating. But that's a big step up from last year, when they were 21st, especially given they haven't had their best offensive player for the first month of the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are they going to win a title with the present roster? No, but in addition to giving their fans something to cheer for, all their players will look much better on paper than they did at the start of this season. If they do decide to trade players, the Heat can get more in return for them. And it's not hard to get free agents to move to Miami if the team is winning and the vibes are good, so they could be a real contender again quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's weird that tanking is seen as the best way to increase the chances of future success in the NBA, rather than building a winning culture and innovating. The two teams with the most success in recent years at doing a major rebuild have been the Spurs and the Thunder. They were both bad for a few years, but they're also two of the best run teams in the league. They draft well, they trade well, they do player development well, they do analytics well. They had a clear vision of the type of team they wanted to build and the clear ability to develop players. If a team doesn't have those organizational competencies, what's the point of a tank? They're just going to waste their high-level draft picks, not develop the rest of the roster, and be mediocre again in 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Power ranking the power rankers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I collected data from six preseason NBA power rankings. There's a link to the spreadsheet at the top of the article. I would've liked to collect more data, and I'm sure there are other sites that did good NBA power rankings, but stuff like that is basically impossible to find these days, lost in a sea of completely LLM generated baloney or locked behind paywalls. It's not useful interrogating why some LLM &lt;em&gt;stochastically decided&lt;/em&gt; that the Warriors are the 4th best team in the NBA this year, but there's seemingly an endless supply of that type of nonsense. Which is to say: thanks for reading this, however you managed to get here. I hope you'll keep coming back for this completely human generated baloney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I compared the rankings from each list to each team's point differential, which is a better estimate of how good a team is than their win-loss record. How good were our mighty morphin' power rankers at predicting the current standings? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the most accurate ranking has been &lt;a href="https://www.rotoballer.com/rss-slideshow/nba-preseason-power-rankings-every-team-from-worst-to-first"&gt;RotoBaller's&lt;/a&gt;, with a Spearman correlation of .76. The worst has been USA Today, at .69. Taking the median rank of all six sources produced a correlation of .74, which was better than 5 out of the 6 individual scores. So we're getting a "wisdom of crowds" effect, which is interesting, since all the rankings are fairly similar to each other. &lt;a href="/majority-voting-in-ensemble-learning.html"&gt;(Previously discussed in &lt;em&gt;Majority voting in ensemble learning&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also included rankings based on my own preseason win total estimates. I got a score of .73, right in the middle of the pack. That's respectable, but I can't believe I'm getting beat by the freaking New York Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing rankings to records, the power rankers were too high on the Clippers, Cavaliers, Pacers, Kings and Warriors. They were too low on the Raptors, Suns, Heat, Spurs and Pistons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strength of schedule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scheduling matters. Some teams have played much harder schedules than others, and we're dealing with small sample sizes, so win-loss records can be deceiving early in the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grabbed adjusted Net Rating (aNET) data from &lt;a href="https://dunksandthrees.com/stats/team"&gt;dunksandthrees&lt;/a&gt;, which calculates the offensive and defensive ratings for each team, adjusted for strength of schedule. I also included Simple Rating System (SRS) data from &lt;a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2025.html"&gt;basketball-reference&lt;/a&gt;, which is the same idea as aNET, but a different methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between aNET and average point differential gives a sense of which team records might be the most misleading compared to the team's actual skill level. For instance, the Sacramento Kings have already played the Thunder, Nuggets and Timberwolves three times apiece, going 2-7 over those games. Even a decent team would be expected to have a losing record against those opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on aNET, the Cavaliers, Warriors, Clippers, Kings and Celtics are probably better than their records indicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going the other way, the Raptors have had a deceptively easy schedule, going 7-1 in games against the woeful Nets, Hornets, Pacers and Wizards. Going 7-1 doesn't tell us much, because those are teams pretty much everybody should be able to beat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stats indicate that the Raptors, Hornets, Spurs, Jazz, and Suns are probably not as good as their records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the teams the power rankers got wrong have been hurt or helped significantly by their schedules so far. The biggest exception has been the Miami Heat, who apparently nobody saw coming, and are probably about as good as their record says they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Kangz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to make of the Kings? According to basketball-reference, they've had the hardest schedule in the league so far. It's fair to say they're not as bad as the record says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they're 28th in point differential, they're 25th by aNET, and 26th by SRS. So they might have 7 or 8 wins instead of 5 if they'd played a league average schedule. That's not that much, though, and a clear step back from last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their rookie, Nique Clifford, has not looked good so far, and they don't have many players that other teams would want in a trade. It doesn't seem like they have any clue of how to develop young talent. Their highest paid player, Zach LaVine, has another year on his contract, doesn't play defense, and has put up a -1.1 VORP this year. They just benched their one big signing of the offseason (Dennis Schröder), and are instead starting Russell Westbrook, a man born during the Reagan Administration playing on a one year minimum deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On paper, they don't have much they can do to get better.  But everybody was saying that about the Heat at the end of last year, and look at them now. I just can't see the Kings having that type of organizational courage, but I hope they find it somehow rather than spend years on another doomed rebuild. Sacramento fans deserve better than another version of the current mess. At least an innovative mess would be a change of pace from trying the same stupid thing over and over. What's the worst that could happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sacramento's roster isn't great, but &lt;a href="/home-of-elvis-and-the-ancient-greeks.html"&gt;like the Grizzlies&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest problems I see are organizational. I understand the Kings are a rich man's toy, not a serious basketball team, but wouldn't it be more fun to own a team that &lt;em&gt;wasn't&lt;/em&gt; a giant tire fire? I don't get spending billions of dollars to buy a sports team just to run it into the ground like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Mathletix Bajillion, week 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual: One of these teams picks NFL games randomly, the other uses a simple algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/topic/ringer-107"&gt;4 of 5 Ringer 107 teams had a losing week&lt;/a&gt;, going 10-15 collectively. All five still have a losing record on the season, so right now the McAul-Stars are the undisputed leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bluster aside, the important thing to notice is how much they're saving taking cheaper lines than the standard -110 odds. The McAul-Stars would be up +110 instead of +176 if the bets were taken at a retail sportsbook, and the Hand-Eggs would be down -620 instead of -563.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lines taken Tuesday morning. Since it's early in the week, the reduced juice isn't quite as juicy as usual.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jimmy Butler: still good&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jimmy Butler: still good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last season, Jimmy Butler quiet quit on his team. He wanted a new contract from the Miami Heat, and they didn't want to give him one, so he just stopped trying. As a fan, it seemed like an annoying and entitled thing to do. He couldn't just play the season out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butler eventually ended up getting traded to the Golden State Warriors, who gave him the extension he wanted, and he started trying again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting aside whether Butler was justified, was the extension worth it or not? Butler is 36 years old, an age where it's totally expected for players to start to decline. The NBA salary cap rules now make it so a team can't afford to get a contract as big as Butler's wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Warriors took a calculated risk, and it paid immediate dividends when Jimmy helped them sneak into the playoffs last year, but the team is about in the same position they were before they got him -- a few high level players, but not in the upper echelon of the league due being old and incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jimmy's doing great, though. He's at career highs in True Shooting (TS%) and effective FG percent (eFG%). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/jimmy-efg.png" src="/img/jimmy-efg.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's always been an efficient scorer, due to his ability to draw a lot of fouls. That means shooting a lot of free throws, which are easy points. Jimmy has been getting about 2.4x the number of free throws per shot attempt compared to the league average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's about where he's been for several seasons now. His free throw rate saw a huge jump when he moved to the Miami Heat in the 2019-2020 season, and he's maintained that ever since:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/jimmy-ftr.png" src="/img/jimmy-ftr.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The career highs in TS% and eFG% probably aren't sustainable, though. Butler's a career 33% 3 point shooter who's making 45% of them this season. I wouldn't bet on that continuing, but he'll always be valuable on offense if he can draw that many free throws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butler's defense is still great, as well. The Warriors are 6.5 points per 100 possessions better on defense when he's on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stands out on all the advanced metrics. Right now, he's 4th in WS/48 (behind Jokic, Shai and Giannis), 8th in PER, 8th in VORP, 3rd in Offensive Rating, 8th in Box Plus/Minus, and 11th in &lt;a href="https://dunksandthrees.com/epm/actual"&gt;EPM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the numbers he's putting up, I think he's worth the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ewing theory, 2025 edition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals don't win games, teams do. Sometimes it can be hard to tell how much of player's individual contribution is actually increasing the likelihood of their team winning. And there's always opportunity cost: perhaps a big man would've been more valuable to this team than Butler has been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a star player gets injured, sometimes a team plays better, a phenomenon Bill Simmons coined "The Ewing Theory". We're seeing some of that this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta Hawks are 2-3 this season when star Trae Young plays, and 9-4 when he doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Memphis Grizzlies are 4-8 when star Ja Morant plays, and 2-4 when he doesn't. (While the win percentage is the same, the team has looked less hapless in those 6 games.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Orlando Magic are 6-6 when star Paolo Banchero plays, and 4-2 when he doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three players have distinctive play styles that their team must run to maximize their talents -- to paraphrase James Harden, they are the system. Sometimes maximizing the opportunities for the best player means wasting some of the talents of the other players on the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar distinctive players like Harden, Jokic and Halliburton are far more essential -- their teams are much worse when they are out, despite the same potential on paper for holding their teams back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the difference between the Hawks, who have been doing better without Trae Young, and the Pacers, who are completely hapless without Tyrese Halliburton? I'm not going to read too much into such small sample sizes, but it's an interesting thing to watch out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SGA's FTAs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debates involving subjects anybody can have an opinion about tend to be much louder than subjects requiring specialized knowledge. It's the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality"&gt;law of triviality&lt;/a&gt;. The purest form of this in sports is the question of who is the most valuable player. TThe NBA version of this debate is probably the loudest and least interesting of any sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are people who don't know much about basketball or statistics, but will argue endlessly on the internet whether BPM or EPM or RAPTOR or VORP is the right metric for deciding who is the best player. Or rather, they decide on the player they like, then find the statistic that says what they want to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the MVP usually comes down to personal preference -- there are always a handful of players that are clearly better than everybody else, and which one is the most valuable among that set is a matter of taste, and often gets decided by narratives rather than anything rigorous. Perhaps rigor is futile. Pretty much every MVP caliber player is a unique basketball talent. None of them are really interchangeable -- they all break the mold in some way. Any sort of all-in-one number is bound to fail at capturing what makes each one special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps because it is a matter of taste and ultimately a very trivial question, people tend to latch onto style points. Who is funnest to watch, who would be the funnest to play with. Who scores points &lt;em&gt;ethically&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;unethically&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who think that Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (SGA) shouldn't be the MVP derisively call him &lt;em&gt;FTA&lt;/em&gt;, implying he gets awarded more free throws than he deserves, or is otherwise a free throw merchant -- someone who baits defenders into fouling him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shai is currently currently the leader in FTAs this year, so the &lt;em&gt;FTA&lt;/em&gt; nickname is accurate in one sense. Here are the 10 players with the most free throw attempts this season, plus Jokić (15th place.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;139&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;29.6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shai's FTr+ of 164 indicates he gets 1.64x more free throws per shot attempt than the average player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a vacuum, that seems high, but everybody on this list has an FTr+ of over 100. They're all good at drawing fouls. Most high volume scorers are. They score a lot and get fouled a lot for the same reason, they're hard to guard. Jimmy Butler is the king, though -- the only player on the list averaging under 20 points a game, and the only one with an FTr over .600. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jimmy's getting 2 free throws per every 3 shots he attempts. Since he makes 80% of them, that's a free half point Butler gets every time he attempts a shot. As far as free throw merchants go, he's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_di_Bicci_de%27_Medici"&gt;Giovanni de' Medici&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to his peers, SGA's free throw rate is pretty tame. It's 7th on this list -- lower than Luka Dončić, Deni Avdija, James Harden, Franz Wagner, Giannis, and Jimmy Butler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a little higher than Jokić's, but I don't know how you decide that an FTr+ of 139 is ethical, but an FTr+ of 164 is unethical (or a sign that the refs are in the tank for SGA). Where's the line? Why do other MVP candidates like Luka and Giannis escape criticism, when they draw more fouls per shot than SGA does?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll take a deeper dive into the topic some other time, but the fact that Luka's free throw rate took a jump when he got traded to the Lakers is another example of why the NBA stands for Not Beating Allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mathletix Bajillion, week 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual: one team picks randomly, one team uses a simple algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the mathletix teams have losing records now, but so do all 5 Ringer teams, so it's still anyone's game. We're still saving a lot of (imaginary) money by shopping for lines, instead of taking them at -110. Even though I got lazy with shopping, I still managed to find all 10 bets at reduced juice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What's going on with the Grizzlies?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest answer is they're miserably bad on offense. It's also the oddest thing about this team to me, since they scored effortlessly last year.

&lt;h3&gt;What's going on with the Grizzlies?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest answer is they're miserably bad on offense. It's also the oddest thing about this team to me, since they scored effortlessly last year. The Grizzlies had found something that worked last season. They had the 6th best Offensive Rating, and 10th best Defensive Rating.  Considering the Indiana Pacers made it within one game of winning the NBA Championship with the 9th best Offensive Rating and 13th best Defensive Rating, the Grizzlies were definitely a borderline contender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, they're 27th in Offensive Rating, 21 positions worse than last year. (The falloff on defense is a little more understandable, since they have several very good defensive players injured right now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eFG+ is a measure of effective FG%, normalized so that 100 is league average.  Here are the top 8 Grizzlies players by minutes played the last two seasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;Santi Aldama&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;96&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;106&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;-10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;Bench 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;Cedric Coward&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;Scottie Pippen Jr&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;105&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;102&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;Bench 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;Cam Spencer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;Brandon Clarke&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;109&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;115&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;-6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for rookie Cedric Coward, every single slot is a downgrade. Wells and Aldama have been significantly worse than last season, but the most dramatic is Ja Morant. The only player with around as many minutes played and a lower eFG+ are &lt;a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/sheppbe01.html"&gt;Ben Sheppard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/walkeja02.html"&gt;Jarace Walker&lt;/a&gt; of the Indiana Pacers, young players who have been forced into playing a lot of minutes due to injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where have all the backup PGs gone?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big problem for the Grizzlies is that they don't really have a backup point guard. They're far from the only team with a lack of PGs on the roster this season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dallas Mavericks have been playing rookie forward Cooper Flagg as PG even though they knew their starting PG, Kyrie Irving, was injured coming into the season. The Nuggets have been experimenting with having forward Peyton Watson as backup PG. The Houston Rockets have no true PG in their "oops, all bigs" starting lineup, though Reed Sheppard is playing more and more off the bench, and looking pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an odd trend to me. Backup point guards have traditionally been cheap and easy to find -- guys like Ish Smith and D.J Augustin. They're like small, functional trucks. They made a ton of them back in the day, but they kinda don't exist anymore, despite how useful and reasonably priced they were. Does that make &lt;a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/k/kawamyu01.html"&gt;Yuki Kawamura&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kei_truck"&gt;Kei truck&lt;/a&gt; of this analogy? Yes, yes it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rockets and Nuggets are doing fine so far without playing a backup PG, but the Grizzlies' situation is just baffling to me. Ja Morant is one of the more injury prone players in the league. You didn't think you needed to find a real backup for him? (Wouldn't Russell Westbrook look good in a Grizzlies uniform?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Grizzlies have a stretch of easier opponents coming up, so I think they'll start looking a little better for that reason alone. Maybe they'll get some mojo back. But I'm always about process, rather than outcomes, and I just don't get the Grizzlies' process right now. They had something pretty cool going last year, and now they don't. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams can't control a lot of factors. Injuries, who they play on a given night, the bounce of the ball on the rim on a last second shot. There's a lot of luck. But the Grizzlies' problems seem to come down to things the coaching staff and front office can control: vision, planning, vibes, communication, style of play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few interesting statistics from the first dozen games of the 2025-26 NBA season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm generally talking about stats per 100 possessions, rather than raw stats (unless otherwise noted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The absurd OKC Thunder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OKC Thunder have been a godless basketball killing machine this …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyF1T1gGuzU" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;Round 6&amp;quot;, by Prince Jammy" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/eyF1T1gGuzU/0.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Song: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyF1T1gGuzU" target="_blank"&gt;"Round 6", by Prince Jammy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few interesting statistics from the first dozen games of the 2025-26 NBA season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm generally talking about stats per 100 possessions, rather than raw stats (unless otherwise noted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The absurd OKC Thunder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OKC Thunder have been a godless basketball killing machine this year. Almost every win is a blowout, despite their second best player being injured. They look like they don't even have to try all that hard, and they're winning by an average of 16 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, their secret sauce is that they make it nearly impossible to score against them. There are no easy buckets. Here are some good ways to get easy points in the NBA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make lots of 3's&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get lots of free throws (and make them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take a lot of shots close to the basket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get points off of turnovers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get out on the fast break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get second chance points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thunder are middle of the pack at the first two. They're only 15th in 3 pointers made against them per game, and 12th in free throws given up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're ridiculously elite at everything else that makes scoring hard. The Thunder are first in the league at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defensive Rating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defensive Rebounding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fewest opponent fast break points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fewest opponent points in the paint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fewest opponent points scored&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lowest opponent effective FG%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're second in the league at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fewest turnovers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fewest opponent points off turnovers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fewest opponent 2nd chance points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fewest opponent assists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most opponent turnovers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most remarkable part is how they've built their team. Their 3rd and 4th leading scorers, Ajay Mitchell and Aaron Wiggins, were both 2nd round draft picks. Their 5th leading scorer, Isaiah Joe, was a 2nd round pick by the 76ers who got waived, then refurbished by the Thunder like an estate sale armoire. Their best defender, Lu Dort, went undrafted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team just finds a way to bring the best out of players that any other team &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have had. What did they see that everybody else missed, and what did they do to develop them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a fan of another NBA team, and someone who lived in Seattle in the 15 years after the Sonics were stolen away to OKC, I &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mr-bones-wild-ride"&gt;want to get off Mr Presti's Wild Ride&lt;/a&gt;. But statistically, it's great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bucking trends&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor Wembanyama is by far the best shot blocker in the NBA, averaging 3.6 blocks a game. But the Spurs are only 6th overall in blocks. Nikola Jokic is by far the best passer in the NBA, but the Nuggets are only 5th overall in assists. Steph Curry is the best 3 point shooter of all time. But the Warriors are only 12th in 3 point percentage. This isn't all that surprising. Just because one player is good at a particular skill, that doesn't mean the rest of the team is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more surprising to me is that Giannis Antetokounmpo draws the most free throws in the league, but the Bucks are 28th in free throw attempts. Teams that get a lot of free throw attempts tend to attack the basket a lot, or be the Los Angeles Lakers. The Bucks are weird because pretty much only Giannis does anything free throw-worthy. At the time I wrote this, Center Myles Turner had not shot a single free throw in his last 63 minutes of game time. That doesn't seem like a recipe for success for the Bucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Basketball is broken&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I know the guy who did it: Nikola Jokić. Advanced stats aren't everything, but right now he has a Win Shares per 48 (WS/48) of .441. Win Shares are probably a little biased towards big men who score efficiently, and affected by the pace of the game. That aside, it's a pretty good stat as far as having a single number to quantify how good somebody is at basketball. It correlates pretty strongly with actual basketball watching, I think. The top players in WS/48 are usually the top candidates for the MVP every year. And it matches who we think the best players are historically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the top player by WS/48 was Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, at .309. The year before, it was Jokic, at .299. The year before, it was Jokic at .308. In 2014, it was Steph Curry, at .288. In 2004, when the pace of play was slower, the leaders were Nowitzki and Garnett at .248. In 1994, it was David Robinson, at .273.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much anything over .250 is an MVP caliber season. There's really no historical precedent for a WS/48 of .441. After 12 games played, Jokic could be the worst player in the league for the next 7 games, and he'd still be having an MVP-type season overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before last game, it was .448. What did Jokic do last game that caused his WS/48 to go down a tiny bit? He got 36 points, 18 rebounds, and 13 assists, on good scoring efficiency and only 2 turnovers. That's a slightly below average game for him right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The perils of hand-rolled metrics, pt. 137&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to put together something to show how historically off the charts OKC has been defensively. I started with using a fancy technique, PCA, before realizing that just adding up the ranks of each of the statistics was better and simpler. If one team is 1st in blocks, 2nd in steals, 2nd in opponent points in thde paint, etc., just add the ranks up, lowest score is best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran it on every team over the last 15 years. All of the teams that did well on my metric were good defensively, and the teams that did poorly were putrid on defense. It's not totally useless. But it's a bad way to find the best teams of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the top defensive teams since 2010 by this metric:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the 2025-26 OKC Thunder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 2018-19 Milwaukee Bucks (won 60 games with peak Giannis)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 2010-11 Philadelphia 76ers (last Iguodala season, young Jrue Holiday)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 2019-20 Orlando Magic (Aaron Gordon and some guys)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 2017-18 Utah Jazz (the "you got Jingled" meme team that beat OKC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah well. That's not a terrible list. They were all very good at defense, and made it a big part of their team identity, but I don't think those are really the best defensive teams of the last 15 years. A team's rank by Defensive Rating is still a better predictor of the team's win percentage than my attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's definitely some &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law"&gt;Goodhart's Law&lt;/a&gt; potential here. OKC are near the top of a bunch of statistical categories, because they are good at defense overall. You can't necessarily get on their level just by trying to copy specific things OKC does well, like prevent fast break points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We see you, Jalen Duren&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More like Jalen Durian, because some of the things he's doing are just nasty. You will definitely get kicked off the bus in Singapore if you're watching Jalen Duren highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was curious what all these gambling shows …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZlY5cozx50" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Scientist, &amp;quot;Plague of Zombies&amp;quot;" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/vZlY5cozx50/0.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Song: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZlY5cozx50" target="_blank"&gt;Scientist, "Plague of Zombies"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a departure from the usual content on here, in that there's no real math or analysis. There's also not much of an audience for this website yet, so I hope you'll indulge me this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was curious what all these gambling shows talk about for hours, when the picks they produce collectively appear to be no better than randomly chosen. I'm always interested in how people make decisions. How does their process work for choosing what bets to take? How might it work better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get too far into this, I know I'm being a killjoy. These podcasts are for entertainment purposes, just like betting is entertainment for a lot of people, not a sincere attempt to make money over the long term. Some degenerate gambling behavior is part of the appeal of these podcasts. They're selling the idea that "gambling is fun" as much as any particular bets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's still weird to be a gambling expert who can't do better than a coin flip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/majority-voting-in-ensemble-learning.html"&gt;I previously showed&lt;/a&gt; how combining multiple machine learning algorithms thru voting will only improve results when they make independent mistakes, and are significantly better than guessing. Those are both pretty intuitive conditions, and I think they're true of groups of people as well. If everybody has the same opinion, or makes the same sort of mistakes, or nobody really knows anything, there can't be a wisdom of crowds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans have a big advantage over combining machine learning algorithms. We can talk with each other, challenge each others' assumptions, provide counterexamples, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's not a ton of that in the gambling podcasts I listened to. Gambling talk is all about inventing stories about the future. It's sort of a competition for who can pitch the best narrative for the game. These stories are almost their own literary genre, and the construction of these are more important than the picks themselves. There aren't a lot of opportunities for the wisdom of crowds or some sort of error correction to occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine I had a magic black box that was right about NBA lines 56% of the time. I could sell those picks, and be one of the better handicappers on the internet. While I could certainly write a little story for each one, maybe in the style of Raymond Carver -- "Will You Please Take The Over, Please?" -- the story doesn't make the bet more likely to be true, though, right? A factual story would be the same for every bet, and not very interesting: "there is slightly more value on this side of the bet, according to the model." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we talk about when we talk about sports betting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gambling personalities are always talking about what has happened in the past -- connections to previous games they've bet on, dubious historical trends, and the tendencies of certain players. Interactions like, "I thought you had a rule never to bet against Baker Mayfield?" "But he's 2-7 on the road in early Sunday games after a Monday night game where he got over 30 rushing yards."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These arbitrary connections remind me of a bit from &lt;a href="https://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/00/pwillen1/lit/citysum.htm"&gt;Calvino's &lt;em&gt;Invisible Cities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ersilia, to establish the relationships that sustain the city's life, the inhabitants stretch strings from the corners of the houses, white or black or gray or black-and-white according to whether they mark a relationship of blood, of trade, authority, agency. When the strings become so numerous that you can no longer pass among them, the inhabitants leave: the houses are dismantled; only the strings and their supports remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were quite a few of those useless strings in the &lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/podcasts/the-ringer-gambling-show/2025/11/06/raiders-broncos-preview-week-10-look-ahead-and-best-bets-for-the-weekend"&gt;November 6th episode of the Ringer Gambling Show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The top bun&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a couple of occasions, the show discussed whether certain information was already priced into the line or not. Since gambling should be about determining which bets have positive expected value, that's a very useful thing to discuss. "If this spread looks wrong, what does the market know that we don't? Or what do we know that the market doesn't?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the goal is to win, the implicit question should always be: why do we think we have an advantage over other gamblers taking the other side? Why are we special? Why do we think the line isn't perfect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Superstitions and biases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were resistant to bet on teams that they had recently lost money on -- not wanting to get burned again. This is clearly not a financial choice, but an emotional one. &lt;a href="/do-you-wanna-win.html"&gt;The axe forgets, the tree remembers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team loyalty also affected their betting decisions. They avoided taking Baltimore because Ariel is a Ravens fan (the bet would have won). Jon suggested betting against his team, the Dolphins, which Ariel jokingly called "an emotional hedge". The Dolphins won. So they cost themselves two potential wins due to their fandom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They decided not to take a bet on Houston (which ended up winning) because, in Jon's words, "betting on Davis Mills is not a pleasant experience". Whether a team or player was fun to bet on came up a couple of other times as well. Someone just trying to make a profit wouldn't care how fun the games are to watch. They might not even watch the games at all. Whether the gambler watches the game or not has no influence on the outcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bets need to be fun, not just a good value. These gambling experts still want to experience "the sweat" -- watching the game and rooting for their bet to win. As I wrote last week, betting on the Browns and losing is like losing twice, so even if the Browns are a better value, they are a bad pick for emotional reasons. Who wants to have to be a Browns fan, if only for a few hours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's sort of like Levi-Strauss said about food. It's not enough that a type of food is good to eat, it must also be good to think about. The Houston Texans led by Davis Mills are not "bon à penser".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Not enough useful disagreement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three of the bets they were in total agreement on (PIT, TB, ARI) lost. Nobody presented a case against those bets, so there was no opportunity for any of them to change their minds or reconsider their beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not endorsing pointless contrarianism -- not every side needs to be argued. Don't be that one guy in every intro to philosophy class. But if both sides of an issue (or a bet) have &lt;em&gt;roughly&lt;/em&gt; equal chances of being true, there should be a compelling case to be made for either side. Someone who can't make both cases fairly convincingly probably doesn't know enough to say which case is stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Two types of hot streaks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For gamblers, there's one type of hot streak that's always bound to end. A team has won a few games it shouldn't have won, therefore they're bound to lose the next one. Their lucky streak will fail. In the real world, there's no invisible hand that pulls things down to their averages on a set schedule. In a small sample size of 17 games in an NFL season, there's no reason to think things will be fair by the end, much less the very next game. Now, a team could be overvalued by the market because they got some lucky wins, which makes them a value to bet against. But teams don't have some fixed number of "lucky games" every year, and once they've burned through those, their luck has to turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other type of hot streak is bound to keep going. The team were divided whether to bet the Rams or not. They decided to go with Ariel's opinion, because she's been on a &lt;em&gt;hot streak&lt;/em&gt; lately. If Ariel's record was demonstrably better than the other two hosts' over a long period of time, it would make sense deferring to her as the tiebreaker. But winning a few bets in a row doesn't mean the next bet is any more likely (or less likely) to win. As a teammate, that's a supportive thing to do, so I'm sure that's part of it. But people who gamble tend to think they &lt;em&gt;have it&lt;/em&gt; sometimes, and &lt;em&gt;don't have it&lt;/em&gt; other times. Sometimes they're hot, sometimes they're cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/tag/the-hot-hand.html"&gt;We've seen this before with NBA basketball&lt;/a&gt;. Basketball players have an innate tendency to believe in the hot hand, even though it doesn't exist, so much so that it actually hurts their performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would the hot hand exist when it comes to predicting the future? What laws of physics would allow someone to predict the future better at some times rather than others? A gambler, regardless of skill level, will occasionally have hot streaks or cold streaks based on chance alone. So a gambler on a &lt;em&gt;hot streak&lt;/em&gt; shouldn't change what type of bets they take, or how much they wager, just like NBA players shouldn't change what type of shots they take. But they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The problem with props&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They suggested a bunch of prop bets. 5 of the 6 suggested were overs -- bets on players scoring at least one touchdown, or going over a certain number of yards. 4 out of 5 of the overs lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamblers greatly prefer betting the over on prop bets, which creates a problem. There's little to no money wagered on the under, which means gamblers taking the over are betting against the house, not other gamblers. That should be a warning sign.  Sportsbooks are rational economic engines. If they're taking on more risk in the form of one-sided bets, they're going to want more reward in the form of a higher profit margin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a lot of prop bets, the big sportsbooks don't even allow taking the under. If a gambler can bet both sides, at least we can calculate the &lt;em&gt;overround&lt;/em&gt;, or profit margin on the bet. With one-sided bets like these, there's no way to know how &lt;em&gt;juiced&lt;/em&gt; the lines are (my guess would be to &lt;a href="https://64.media.tumblr.com/e91782455e611125cf20b32b5af467f2/tumblr_o83n41AhtQ1spaqz2o7_r1_250.gif"&gt;Buster Bluth&lt;/a&gt; levels.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/no-unders.png" src="/img/no-unders.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, a sportsbook wants to have equal action on both sides of a bet. They don't really care what the line is. As long as the money's basically even (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_of_bookmaking"&gt;they have &lt;em&gt;made a book&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), they can expect to make money no matter which team comes out on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these one sided prop bets, there's no way for the free market to move the price by people betting the under instead. So the line doesn't need to be that close to the actual odds. Without action on both sides, sportsbooks have to be extremely vigilant about never setting an inaccurate line that gives the over too much of a chance of winning. And I don't think that gamblers taking overs on prop bets are too price sensitive. So the sportsbooks have multiple reasons to make the overs a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even sportsbooks that offer unders charge a huge amount of vig on prop bets to offset the additional uncertainty to the sportsbook. There are so many prop bets on each game relative to the number of people who take them. They can get away with setting the lines algorithmically because the lines don't need to be all that accurate with a bunch of extra juice on top. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This screenshot is from an offshore "reduced juice" sportsboook that allows bets on the unders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/lowvig-props.png" src="/img/lowvig-props.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can convert the lines to win probabilities and add them up to calculate the overround, as covered a couple of articles ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Saquon Barkley bet, the overround is 8.9%. For Hurts it's 8.3%, for Brown it's 7.4%, and 7.9% for Smith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overround for a normal spread bet is 4.5%. We saw it's about the same with NBA money lines.  Because this book is &lt;em&gt;reduced juice&lt;/em&gt;, overrounds on spread bets are around 2.6% -- for instance odds of &lt;code&gt;-108/-102&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-105/-105&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;-110/-110&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prop bets have 2x the juice of a traditional spread bet, and over 3x reduced juice. That requires the gambler to win far more often just to break even. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ways to potentially reduce bias&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/sports-betting-and-the-limits-of-rationality.html"&gt;I've previously written about an experiment&lt;/a&gt; that showed gamblers tend to take the favorite, even when they've been told it's a worse bet than the underdog. That wasn't true of the Ringer teams last week. They only took 11 favorites out of 25, so they didn't show that particular bias. But I think the experiment gives a hint how to reduce bias in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people could be corrected of their bias towards favorites by writing out what they thought the lines should be before seeing what the lines were. It causes the person to actually try and do the math problem of whether the bet is a good investment or not, rather than anchoring on the price set by the market, and picking the better team, or the conventional wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to try having each team member decide what the fair line was, then average them out. Do predictions made that way perform better? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it would be helpful to convert any odds from the American style (like +310, or -160) to the equivalent probability. People who have gambled a lot might have an intuitive sense of what -160 means, but for me, the equivalent 61.5%, or "about 5/8" is much clearer. I can imagine a large pizza missing 3 of the 8 slices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betting jargon and betting superstitions should be avoided. Does each bet make sense as a &lt;em&gt;financial transaction&lt;/em&gt;? Personal feelings and the enjoyability of the bet shouldn't factor in. The quality of the game and who is playing in it shouldn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The bottom bun&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite not being a gambler, the gambling podcasts I listened to were fairly enjoyable. It's basically Buddies Talk About Sports, which is a pleasant enough thing to have on in the background. Nobody would listen to Casey's Rational Betting Show, for multiple reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Mathletix Bajillion, week 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ringer crew had a good week, collectively going 14-11 (56%). One team out of five is now in the green. mathletix still won the week, winning 60% of our bets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, one set of picks is generated algorithmically, the other randomly. I'll reveal which one at the end of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"line shopping" refers to how much money was saved, or extra money was gained, by taking the best odds available instead of betting at a retail sportsbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All lines as of Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Are betting experts any good at what they do?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, nearly all talk about gambling I see on TV and the internet is sponsored by one of the sportsbooks. How good is all this sponsored advice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few shows that are …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UDJSy2zyz0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Charlie Musselwhite, &amp;quot;Cristo Redentor&amp;quot;" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/8UDJSy2zyz0/0.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Are betting experts any good at what they do?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, nearly all talk about gambling I see on TV and the internet is sponsored by one of the sportsbooks. How good is all this sponsored advice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few shows that are just about gambling, but more common are ad reads from Youtubers or sportscasters who are sponsored by sportsbooks, but aren't really focused on gambling. These appear on-air in the middle of a game, or an ad break in a Youtube video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picks from sports announcers do terribly, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyKHR0batTE"&gt;as the Youtube channel Foolish Baseball has documented in their wonderful video, &lt;em&gt;Baseball is Ruining Gambling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a numbers guy, it's baffling that anybody would follow these obviously sponsored picks at obviously juiced lines, given by obviously casual gamblers, but some people are taking them, because the sportsbooks keep paying for the ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gambling is a social and parasocial activity now, another thing you do on your phone when you're bored that sort of feels like interacting with other humans, but isn't. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some gamblers want to be on the same side of the bet as their favorite YouTuber, who give their favorite picks as a part of an ad read. The apps also allow you to follow people, and take the same bets they take. It's yet another one-way online relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other gamblers take bets to feel more connected to their team. Announcer parlays are invitations to take a financial interest in the game that you're already watching, not necessarily because you think the Brewers play-by-play guy is secretly a betting wizard. The baseball announcers don't seem to have much of an interest in gambling, or being touts. They're not there for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyKHR0batTE"&gt;our wholesome national pastime, gambling on sports&lt;/a&gt;, they're true sickos who are only interested the disreputable game of baseball. Putting together some half-ass parlay for the promo is part of their job. It's just another ad read. It may as well be a local roofing company or a personal injury lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sportsbooks advertise because it makes them money in the long run. These companies seem pretty well-run, if nothing else. They want to sponsor people who are good at bringing in customers with a high Customer Lifetime Value -- people who will lose over and over again for years, making back the cost to acquire them as a customer many times over. That's it. That's the game. Why would they sponsor people who give good advice about gambling, or good picks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Do people care whether gambling experts are actually good or not?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some guys talk about gambling for a living. They discuss sports from the perspective of people who are gamblers first, and sports fans second. Everything's an angle, or a trend, or a bad beat. At the extreme, athletic competitions are interesting because betting on them is interesting, not because sports themselves are. These guys are both living and selling the gambling lifestyle, which I talk much more about in the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A parasocial relationship with a guy selling picks or talking about gambling on a podcast causes guys to want to form social relationships around gambling. They're Gambling Guys now. Which leads to an endless parade of dudes complaining about their parlays online, and, I would wager, annoying the heck out of their significant others. "It's a whole lifestyle, Sherri! Of course I had to get my tips frosted! I'm a Gambling Guy now!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all imaginary. An imaginary relationship with a betting guru in the form of a "hot tip". An imaginary relationship with the sporting event or player in the form of a bet. An imaginary relationship with reality itself in the form of the rationalization about why the "hot tip" didn't win. An imaginary relationship between winning and skill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a sports fan is already ridiculous enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Poking the bear, a bit&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theringer.com"&gt;The Ringer&lt;/a&gt; is a website about sports and pop culture that has evolved into a podcasting empire. I like a lot of what they do, and I especially appreciate that they publish great writing that surely isn't profitable for the company. For the most part, I can just enjoy their non-gambling content and ignore that it's subsidized by gambling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they've done as much as anyone to normalize sports betting as a lifestyle, and deserve an examination of that. The Ringer wasn't worth a bajillion dollars before gambling legalization, back when they were doing MeUndies ad reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ringer has an incredible amount of content that's just Gambling Guys Talk Gambling with Other Gambling Guys, around 10 hours a week of podcasts, by my count. The Ringer's flagship show is the Bill Simmons Podcast, which usually devotes at least a couple hours a week to discussing which bets Bill and his pals think are good. (&lt;a href="/cool-parlay-bro.html"&gt;Previously satirized in &lt;em&gt;Cool Parlay, Bro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site also has an hour long &lt;em&gt;daily&lt;/em&gt; podcast about gambling, &lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/podcasts/the-ringer-gambling-show"&gt;The Ringer Gambling Show&lt;/a&gt;, and several other podcasts that regularly discuss betting. As far as I know, all of their sports podcasts feature gambling ad reads, even the ones with hosts that clearly find gambling distasteful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several members of the Ringer's staff are full time Gambling Guys now. They talk about their addictions for a living, which must be nice. I've been talking about my crippling data science addiction on here for months without a single job offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are these guys good at their job, though? (Are they good at their addictions?) The Ringer is currently having a contest betting on the NFL between five different NFL podcasts, four of which primarily cover sports gambling, which they're calling &lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/topic/ringer-107"&gt;The Ringer 107&lt;/a&gt;.  Here are their results through Week 9:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/not-great-bob.png" src="/img/not-great-bob.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single one of the five teams is losing money against the spread. They don't make it clear on the website, but some bets are at &lt;code&gt;-120&lt;/code&gt; vig, so the records are even worse than they look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be bad luck, right? I've &lt;a href="/do-you-wanna-win.html"&gt;written at length&lt;/a&gt; about how having a true skill level of 55% doesn't guarantee actually winning 55% of the bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this data, it's extremely unlikely the gambling pros at the Ringer are just unlucky. I simulated 5 teams taking the same number of bets as the Ringer's contest so far. If every pick had a 55% chance of winning (representing picks by advantage players), then 99.5% of the time, &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; one team does better than all five of the Ringer's did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even at a 50% winning rate, same as flipping a coin, the simulation does better than the Ringer 91% of the time. Based on this data, you'd be better off flipping a coin than listening to these gambling experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The easiest way to know they can't do it&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I talked about gambling for a living and was demonstrably good at it, I'd want everyone to see the proof. These guys almost never post their actual records over a long stretch of time, though. They will crow about their wins, and offer long-winded explanations as to why their losing picks were actually right, and reality was wrong. But it's hard to find actual win-loss records for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last season, The Ringer's Anthony Dabbundo didn't appear to keep track of his record betting on the NFL against the spread at all (&lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/2025/01/02/nfl/best-bets-nfl-week-18-steelers-bengals-vikings-lions-chiefs-broncos"&gt;example article&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/2025/11/06/nfl/best-nfl-bets-week-10-odds-predictions-eagles-packers"&gt;This year&lt;/a&gt;, he has, so we know he's gone 37-37, and 20-25 on his best bets, despite some of them being at worse than &lt;code&gt;-110&lt;/code&gt; odds. His best bets have had a return of &lt;code&gt;-16.7%&lt;/code&gt;, about the same as lazy MLB announcer parlays, and almost 4 times worse than taking bets by flipping a coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What odds would you give me that the Ringer goes back to not showing his record next season?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I don't think Dabbundo is worse than the average gambling writer at gambling. I've never found a professional Gambling Guy that is statistically better than a coin flip. Dabbundo's job is writing/podcasting the little descriptions that go along with each of his picks. His job isn't being good at gambling, it's being good at talking about gambling. There is no evidence that he can predict the future but plenty of evidence he can crank out an hour of podcast content every weekday that enough people enjoy listening to. Predicting the future isn't really the value-add for these sorts of shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The curse of knowledge&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's significant that by far the worst team in the contest is the Ringer NFL Show, which is primarily not about gambling. It's a show by extreme football nerds, for extreme football nerds. Once in a while I listen to it while doing the dishes, and I'll go like 20 minutes without recognizing a single player or football term they're talking about. They are all walking football encyclopedias, as far as I'm concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If gambling really were a matter of football-knowing, they should be winning. They aren't, because betting isn't a football-knowing contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see how being a true expert might make somebody worse at gambling. Every bet is a math problem, not a trivia question. A bet at a &lt;code&gt;-4.5&lt;/code&gt; spread might have a positive expected value, but a &lt;code&gt;-5.5&lt;/code&gt; spread have a negative expected value. People who are good at sports gambling can somehow tell the difference. Like life, sports gambling is a game of inches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The folks on the Ringer NFL Show know the name of the backup Left Tackle for every team in the league, but I don't think that's really an advantage in knowing whether &lt;code&gt;-4.5&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-5.5&lt;/code&gt; is the right number for a particular game. Most of the cool football stuff they know should already be baked into the line, or is irrelevant. Sports betting is a lot more like &lt;em&gt;The Price Is Right&lt;/em&gt; than it is like sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great chef might know practically everything there is to know about food. They might know what type of cheese is the tastiest, how to cook with it, and so on. But if they went to the grocery store, that doesn't mean they would notice that they had gotten charged the wrong price for the cheese, or that they could get it 20% cheaper at another store. That's a totally different skillset and mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People on these gambling shows spend several minutes explaining each of their picks, listing lots of seemingly good reasons. I think that having to give a good reason for each pick forces them into going with what they know, not considering that all the obvious information and most of the non-obvious information they have is already reflected in the line. Needing to be seen as an expert could lead them to pick the side with slightly less value on it, because they want to make a defensible pick. It's much better to have a good sounding reason for making a pick, and losing, than it is to have no reason for making a pick and winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I think every bet has a more reasonable side and a crazier side. Anybody prognosticating for a living has a disincentive to pick the crazier side if they're going to have to explain the bet if they happen to lose. It doesn't if there was actually more value than the Browns. Losing on the Browns and then having to live with being the guy who bet on the Browns is two losses at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Mathletix Bajillion, week 10&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured I should take a crack at it. The season is mostly over, so it will be a small sample size, but let's see what happens. At the very least, it will force me to publish something at least once a week for the next couple of months, and if things go bad, work on developing the shamelessnesss of someone who gets paid to predict the future, even though they can't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to make two sets of picks, one based on a proprietary betting model I created, the other purely random, based on rolling dice. At the end, I will reveal which team is which, and see how they do against the Ringer's teams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an extremely casual fan of the NFL, so little to no actual ball-knowing will go into these picks. I probably know less about football than the average person who bets on football. I don't think that's really a disadvantage when the football experts are going 18-27 on the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will take all bets at -110 odds or better. No cheeky -120 bets to goose the win-loss record a bit, like some of the teams in the Ringer competition have done. But I will also shop around between sportsbooks and take the best lines I can find, by checking sites like unabated, reduced juice sportsbooks like lowvig and pinnacle, and betting exchanges like matchbook and prophetx. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the betting exchanges, I will only take spreads where there is at least $1000 in liquidity -- no sniping weird lines. Part of what I'm trying to show is that bargain shopping, which has nothing to do with football knowledge, can make a big difference. So I will shop pretty aggressively. Even if I lose, I will lose less fake money than I would at -110, which means I don't have to win as often to be profitable. I'm pretty confident I can beat the Ringer pros on that point at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;NBA Push Charts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past couple of posts, I've looked at NBA betting data from BetMGM. There are multiple types of bets available on every game. A &lt;em&gt;push chart&lt;/em&gt; maps the fair price of a spread bet to the equivalent money line bet. How often does a team that is favored by 3 points win the game outright? It's going to be less often than a team favored by 10 points. The money line should reflect those odds of winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find a lot of push charts online, but they tend to be based on older NBA data. With more variance due to a lot of 3 point shots, and more posessions per game, I wouldn't expect them to still be accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Push charts are useful for assessing which of two different wagers is the better value. Here's an example of a game where different sportsbooks have different lines for the same game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/pushchart.png" src="/img/pushchart.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you want to bet on the Warriors. They have some players out tonight (Nov 5, 2025) so they're the underdogs, but they are also playing the dysfunctional Kangz, so it might be a good value bet. You could take the Warriors at either &lt;code&gt;+3.5 -114&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;+3 -110&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;+2.5 -105&lt;/code&gt;. Which bet has the highest expected value? If the Warriors lose by 3, the +3.5 bet would win, but the +3 bet would push (the bet is refunded), and the +2.5 bet would lose. A push chart can give a sense of how valuable the half points from +2.5 to +3, and +3 to +3.5, are. Is the probability of the Warriors losing by exactly 3 -- the value of getting a push -- worth going from &lt;code&gt;-105&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;-110&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[edit: the Warriors, without their 3 best players, led for most of the game before eventually losing by 5 after Russell Westbrook had one of his best games in years. So the line was only off by 2 points. The lines are often uncannily close, even when a bunch of weird stuff happens. Sometimes it all kinda cancels out.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to do a push chart two different ways, then combine them. For almost every game over the last 4 years, we have the money line and the spread, so we can match them up directly. These will have the vig baked in. And as we saw previously, the money line for favorites has a slightly better expected value than the average bet on the spread. So it's going to end up a little biased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also calculate a push chart without any vig by looking at winning percentage for every spread -- what percent of the time does a +3.5 point underdog actually win the game. It will need some smoothing, since the data will be noisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The retail NBA push chart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I matched up the spread and the money line for both the home and the away team on each game, then took the median of those values. Spreads in the range of -0.5 to +0.5 are very rare, as are spreads over -13.5/+13.5, so I've omitted those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;|spread |money line|
|------:|---------:|
| -13.5 |  -1000   |
| -12.5 |   -750   |
| -11.5 |   -650   |
| -10.5 |   -550   |
|  -9.5 |   -450   |

|  -4.5 |   -190   |
|  -3.5 |   -160   |
|  -2.5 |   -140   |
|  -1.5 |   -120   |
|   1.5 |    100   |
|   2.5 |    115   |
|   3.5 |    135   |
|   4.5 |    155   |
|   5.5 |    180   |
|   6.5 |    200   |
|   7.5 |    240   |
|   8.5 |    290   |
|   9.5 |    340   |
|  10.5 |    400   |
|  11.5 |    475   |
|  12.5 |    525   |
|  13.5 |    625   |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives us how BetMGM prices the value of individual points on the spread (with the vig figured in). This is sort of their official price list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American style odds are symmetrical if there is no vig involved. A &lt;code&gt;-400&lt;/code&gt; bet implies a 4/5 chance of winning, and a &lt;code&gt;+400&lt;/code&gt; bet implies a 1/5 chance of winning. If the &lt;code&gt;-400&lt;/code&gt; bet wins 4/5 of the time and loses 1/5 of the time, the gambler breaks even, and vice versa. So a no-vig money line would be &lt;code&gt;+400/-400&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odds offered by the sportsbooks are asymmetrical, because they want to make money. We see that &lt;code&gt;+13.5&lt;/code&gt; on the spread maps to a &lt;code&gt;+625&lt;/code&gt; money line, but &lt;code&gt;-13.5&lt;/code&gt; maps to &lt;code&gt;-1000&lt;/code&gt;. A +625 bet should win 100/(100+625), or about 14% of the time.  A -1000 bet should win 1000/1100, or 91% of the time. Adding those together, we get &lt;code&gt;91% + 14% = 105%&lt;/code&gt;. That extra 5% is called &lt;em&gt;the overround&lt;/em&gt;, and is the bookmaker's guaranteed profit, assuming they have equal wagers on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what that data looks like as a graph, with some smoothing added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/push-smooth.png" src="/img/push-smooth.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this shows the bias against heavy favorites that we saw previously. Note how the line gets much steeper moving from -10 to -20 on the spread, versus moving from +10 to +20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At -20.5, this graph gives a payout of -5000, but at +20.5, it gives a payout of +1320. The fair payout is somewhere in between those two numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the fair payout is (-5000/+5000), then the underdog is getting way less of a payout (in essence, paying more in vig) than they should. If the fair payout is closer to (-1360/+1360), then the favorite is paying more in vig than they should.  So the asymmetricality gives a clue that sportsbooks aren't splitting the vig down the middle, but it doesn't tell us the fair price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Push charts based on win frequencies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can estimate a fair price by going through all the games and see how often a +3.5 underdog wins outright, then convert that percentage to a fair money line. The problem here is that the results will be very noisy. We'd need hundreds or thousands of games at each spread value, and we only have 4,500 or so games overall. So it's gonna be chunky. We'll have to do some smoothing on it, (foreshadowing alert: it will lead to weird results later on)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the win ratios by spread, combining both home and away teams:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;| spread| win ratio |

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team with a -1.5 point spread wins 52.6% of the time, which is very close to the break-even point on standard -110 bets of 52.4%. So a gambler needs to be at least 1.5 points better than Vegas at setting the lines to expect to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These odds have to be symmetrical. If a team favored by -4.5 wins 60% of the time, then a +4.5 point underdog has to win 40% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this data is probably too &lt;em&gt;chunky&lt;/em&gt; to give good results. &lt;code&gt;-4.5&lt;/code&gt; has a lower win rate than &lt;code&gt;-5.5&lt;/code&gt;, which doesn't make any sense. The more negative the spread, the higher the win rate should be. Here's what it looks like with smoothing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/spread-smooth.png" src="/img/spread-smooth.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can convert these winning percentages to fair (no vig) money lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/fair-money-lines.png" src="/img/fair-money-lines.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Converting to money lines doesn't break the symmetry. A -4.5 favorite gets a money line of -163, and a 4.5 point underdog gets a money line of +163.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a first attempt. Different ways of smoothing the actual win rates will lead to different results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Crossing the streams, and an abrupt ending&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if we look at the difference between the no-vig moneylines, and what the sportsbook actually charges? Will it show us the favorite-longshot bias?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out, it doesn't. The win frequency data is too noisy. I spent a lot of time spinning my wheels on it, before realizing I didn't have enough data. I will come back to the subject, though, because failure is more educational than success.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="sports betting"></category><category term="basketball"></category><category term="your parlay sucks"></category></entry><entry><title>Overs, money lines, and pigeonholes</title><link href="/overs-money-lines-and-pigeonholes.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-10-26T10:20:00-10:00</published><updated>2025-10-26T10:20:00-10:00</updated><author><name>casey durfee</name></author><id>tag:None,2025-10-26:/overs-money-lines-and-pigeonholes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9-rmzBhHS8" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Pigeonhed, &amp;quot;Glory Bound&amp;quot; (Dave Ruffy Remix)" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/h9-rmzBhHS8/0.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A little crowd wisdom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, we saw that for NBA spread bets, the more popular side wins 49.2% of the time. This matches &lt;a href="/small-stakes-give-you-the-minimum-blues.html"&gt;what I've shown before&lt;/a&gt; -- the public is generally worse than a coin …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9-rmzBhHS8" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Pigeonhed, &amp;quot;Glory Bound&amp;quot; (Dave Ruffy Remix)" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/h9-rmzBhHS8/0.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A little crowd wisdom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, we saw that for NBA spread bets, the more popular side wins 49.2% of the time. This matches &lt;a href="/small-stakes-give-you-the-minimum-blues.html"&gt;what I've shown before&lt;/a&gt; -- the public is generally worse than a coin flip when betting on NBA basketball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, I have some good news. There are some types of bets on the NBA where the public do a little better than expected. Not enough to make money, but better than picking bets by flipping a coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Money line bets and rationality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/lessons-from-four-years-of-nba-gambling-stats.html"&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt;, I looked at money line bets and showed that there is a bias against slight to heavy underdogs, and a possible bias against very heavy favorites. There's a lot I didn't get to, though. What kind of money line bets do the public prefer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public takes the home team 63% of the time, which is a little high given the home team wins 55% of games. The public also takes the money line favorite in 96% (4656/4839) of NBA games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that rational or not? We know that favorites are a slightly better deal than underdogs on the money line, so in one sense it is. If someone offered you a free money line bet on the NBA, you should probably pick the favorite. The expected value is less bad than the underdog, so it's a better choice in the long run, and your chances of making &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; money on the bet are much higher, so it's perhaps a better choice as a single bet as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gambler taking half favorites and half underdogs has a chance at winning 100% of their bets, but someone taking a highly imbalanced number of favorites (or underdogs) will have a whole lot of guaranteed losses. The gambler might correctly pick every single favorite, but close to half of their bets on favorites are still going to be losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting pigeonholed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money lines are all at different odds, which complicates things. For this example, let's say the gambler is taking spread bets, with both sides having a roughly equal chance of winning. There are 1230 games in the season, we'll assume the favorite is a slightly better deal, so wins 51% of the time, and the gambler takes the favorite 96% of the time.  Over 1230 games, the favorites go 627-603. The gambler takes 1181 favorites and 49 underdogs on the season.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best they can possibly do on favorites is 627/1181 (53%), assuming they somehow manage to correctly bet on every single favorite that won that season. The gambler captured all of the favorites that won, so the rest of the games left over are underdog winners, meaning they'd go a perfect 49/49 in underdog games. Overall, the best they can do is (627+49)/1230, which is 54.9%. Since the break-even point is 52.4%, most of the profits are coming from the 49 underdog games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking so many favorites, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle"&gt;the pigeonhole principle&lt;/a&gt; means the gambler has to be perfect just to hit a 54.9% win rate. &lt;a href="/do-you-wanna-win.html"&gt;As I showed in &lt;em&gt;Do you wanna win?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 54.9% is good enough to have a positive expected value on bets, but it's low enough that losing money over 1,230 bets is very possible, even with proper bankroll management. If hitting that number requires you to be perfect, it seems like a bad plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the frequencies of odds taken by the public on the money line. There's an awkward gap in the middle. In the American way of writing odds, favorites are always -100 or smaller, and underdogs are always +100 or bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="money-line-frequencies" src="/img/money-line-frequencies.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public mostly takes bets in the -100 to -300 range, which is in the range where money line bets have been a slightly better value than spread bets over the past four seasons, so good for them. The biggest underdog bet the public took in nearly 5,000 bets was at +400 (implying the underdog had a 20% chance of winning.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public achieved -2.87% rate of return on money line bets. That's bad compared to the 0% rate of return offered by not betting, but it's better than the -4.5% on spread bets, and way better than the -20% on some types of parlay bets. Someone &lt;em&gt;fading&lt;/em&gt;, or taking the opposite bets to the public, would achieve a -6.4% rate of return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the rare occasions the public does take the underdog, they make a profit. On those 183 bets, the public notched a +2.43% rate of return.  Bets on underdogs will have a high amount of variance, so there could be some luck involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Point totals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to who will win the game, gamblers can wager on how many total points will be scored. For instance, if the final score is 120-115, the point total would be 235. If the line was 230, the OVER side would have won, and the UNDER lost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point totals are pretty balanced. The over wins 50.6% (2672/5273) of the time. However, the public takes the over 88.3% (4660/4839) of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public did a little better than a coin flip, winning 51% of over bets, and 54.5% of the 178 under bets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was curious whether the percent of bets on one side was correlated with higher winning percentage. If 99% of the public took the over, is that a safer bet than if only 51% of the public took it? I've broken down the public's bets on the over by quartiles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;start %&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;end %&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;num games&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;win    %&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;73.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1165&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;50.5%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;73.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;82.4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1164&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;51.4%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;82.4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;88.4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1163&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;50.9%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;88.4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1168&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;51.5%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 1,000 observations, a 95% confidence interval is roughly +/- &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1000}} \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt(33*30)} \approx 3\%\)&lt;/span&gt;, which is much bigger than the difference between 50.5% and 51.5%. So the difference isn't significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Are sportsbooks leaving money on the table?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's odd to me that the over would win more than 50% of the time when that's the side that usually has the most money on it. That's not a huge imbalance, but the sportsbooks would be making more money if they increased the point totals a bit so the over loses 51% of the time instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamblers betting on point totals are probably a little more savvy than ones betting the lines. It's kind of an odd thing to bet on. Doesn't matter who won, doesn't matter whether it was a good game or not. All bets are math problems, but point totals are more obviously a math problem than money lines or spreads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do point totals tell us anything about the evolution of the NBA?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible sportsbooks haven't kept up with the evolution of the game. NBA point totals have gotten much higher over the past decade due to faster pace, better shooting and more 3 pointers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a graph of moving averages of the point totals for the past four seasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="point-total-yoy" src="/img/point-total-yoy.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point totals go down at the end of every year. That's because playoff games tend to be more tightly contested than regular season games. The vertical line is where the playoffs start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There appears to be an increase in average point totals during the 2021 season, but it's stayed fairly consistent since then, with one notable exception. There's an big dip in point totals during the 2023 season, around game 800. This is almost certainly due to &lt;a href="https://clutchpoints.com/nba/nba-stories/nba-news-adam-silver-admission-officiating"&gt;a directive from the NBA telling officials to call fewer fouls&lt;/a&gt;. Fans (and presumably gamblers) noticed right away, but the NBA only admitted the change well after the fact. Luckily, nothing has happened since then to further undermine trust in the NBA! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QYbZsBPawI" target="_blank"&gt;The Meters, "People Say"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="/the-public-wants-what-the-public-gets.html"&gt;a previous installment&lt;/a&gt;, I looked at statistics about NBA gambling that I obtained from sportsbookreview.com. I thought it was pretty interesting, but there were some huge gaps in the data, and I wasn't sure what sportsbook some of it was coming from. So I didn't have a ton of confidence in my results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it was a pretty cool idea, though, so I tracked down a better source of data via Yahoo's NBA pages. Yahoo loads gambling data from the BetMGM sportsbook, and I found a nice internal API for getting it all. I was able to get data on the past four seasons of NBA games, and although data is missing for some games, it's much more complete, and has a bunch more info, than the original dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All code and data is available online at &lt;a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/scrape_yahoo_odds/"&gt;https://github.com/csdurfee/scrape_yahoo_odds/&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;explore.ipynb&lt;/code&gt; notebook has all the calculations and charts used in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual with gambling content, I'm presenting this data because I think it is interesting to study how it works, and what it tells us about basketball and human nature. Math is cool. Basketball is cool. Human nature is frequently not cool, but always interesting. Gambling is lame.  If you have money burning a hole in your pocket, please give it to me instead of the MGM Grand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, lecture over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data I'm looking at is every regular season and playoff NBA game from the 2021-22, 2022-23, 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 seasons. No preseason games or All-Star games, but the Emirates NBA Cup championship game is included. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 435 games that are missing stake/wager data (the percentage of money and bets placed on each side, respectively.) That leaves 4,840 NBA games that I have analyzed. The stake and wager percentages seem to be pretty similar to each other, so I'm just using the wager data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do the spreads look like? Are there any obvious biases?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home team went 2393-2447 (49.5%) against the spread over the last 4 years. The favorite team went 2427-2413 (50.1%) against the spread in that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home team was the favorite in 3044/4840 (62.8%) of games. The median spread is the home team -3.5 (favored by 3.5 points). Here are the frequencies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="home-spread-frequencies" src="/img/home-spread-frequencies.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basketball games never end in a tie, and there are strategic reasons why NBA games rarely end in a one point difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around half of all home lines are one of -2.5, -1.5, -4.5, -3.5, +1.5, -6.5, -5.5, -7.5 or +2.5 (in descending order of frequency).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;98.3% of all MGM lines are on the half point (eg 8.5 instead of 8). This is so the sportsbook can avoid pushes (ties), where they have to give everybody's money back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More evidence of the folly of crowds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, some betting jargon, if you're new here. Teams that are popular with bettors are known as &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; teams. The side of a particular bet that gets more &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt; is known as the &lt;em&gt;public side&lt;/em&gt;. If that side of the bet won, people say &lt;em&gt;the public won&lt;/em&gt;. Betting the less popular side is known as &lt;em&gt;fading the public&lt;/em&gt;. When the less popular side wins against the spread, people will say &lt;em&gt;Vegas won&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;sharps won&lt;/em&gt; (a &lt;em&gt;sharp&lt;/em&gt; is someone who is good at betting, as opposed to a &lt;em&gt;square&lt;/em&gt;, who is bad at betting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the stake/wager data, we can find out which team was more popular to bet on for each game. How do those &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; teams do collectively? Are the public any better or worse at making picks than just flipping a coin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to well-earned cynicism, I was expecting that the public would be a bit worse than a coin flip. And they are. &lt;em&gt;The public&lt;/em&gt; went 2381-2459 (49.19%) against the spread over the past 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public greatly prefer betting on the away team. 2742/4840 (56.7%) of public bets are on the away team. The public also greatly prefer favorites. 2732/4840 (56.4%) of bets are on them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how the bets break down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;favorite&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;dog&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;AWAY&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;1215&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;1527&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;HOME&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;1517&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;581&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This crosstab is a little misleading. The home team is usually favored, so there are fewer home underdogs than road underdogs. However, there's still a discrepancy. The home team is the underdog 37% of the time, but only 27% of bets on underdogs are on the home team, and 28% of bets on the home team are on underdogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 4 categories, the only one with a winning record for the public is away favorites -- 623-592 (51.3% win rate). The second best type is home underdogs, which went 289-292 (49.7%). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two most popular bet types with the public are big losers. Away underdogs went 742-785 (48.6%), and home favorites went a putrid 727-792 (47.9%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, someone taking the public side of every bet over the past 4 years would have lost 324 units. If they bet $100 on every game, they would be down $32,400. Someone taking the opposite side of all these bets (&lt;em&gt;fading the public&lt;/em&gt;) would "only" lose 160 units, or $16,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would've been profitable betting &lt;em&gt;reduced juice&lt;/em&gt; (risk 106 to win 100 instead of 110) to &lt;em&gt;fade the public&lt;/em&gt; on all away underdog and home favorite picks. The problem with that strategy is that reduced juice sportsbooks actively attract smart players, so they have &lt;em&gt;sharper&lt;/em&gt; (more accurate) lines. A retail sportsbook like BetMGM doesn't need &lt;em&gt;sharp&lt;/em&gt; lines because they ban any players who win too much. Against &lt;em&gt;sharp&lt;/em&gt; lines, I wouldn't expect the strategy to be profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How have teams done against the spread over the past 4 years?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past 4 seasons, team records against the spread appear fairly random. The only real outlier is the Oklahoma City Thunder, who have won an astounding 59.3% of their games against the spread. This is remarkable to me because they've been one of the best and most hyped teams in basketball the past couple years. They dominated the league last season, winning 68/82 (82.9%) games, and the NBA Championship. They're not exactly an under the radar team. Yet they appear to have been underestimated by both &lt;em&gt;Vegas&lt;/em&gt; and the betting public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw &lt;em&gt;the public&lt;/em&gt; likes to bet on the away team, and the favorite. Do they have team-specific tendencies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They certainly do. The LA Lakers and Golden State Warriors are most popular, being the picked by the public in 72% of their games. Detroit and Orlando are the least popular, only getting the majority of bets in 31% of their games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very similar ranking to what I saw in the previous data -- the public don't appear to be picking bets for purely rational reasons. They like to bet on popular teams, good teams, and teams with popular players. They don't like to bet on unpopular or bad teams, even though both sides have the same chance of winning against the spread. It makes sense as an aesthetic choice, but not as a mathematical choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a bit of correlation (r = .08) between team popularity and their record against the spread. Bettors do slightly prefer to bet on teams that do well against the spread:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="popularity-vs-spread" src="/img/popularity-vs-spread.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma City is that lonely dot far off to the right, far better than every other team but only slightly more popular than average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Money lines and the favorite/longshot bias&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I've only been looking at bets against the spread. This new dataset also includes info on money line bets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, money line bets are easier to understand -- just bet on the team you think will win. If you like the favorite, you will win less than you risk; if you like the underdog you win more than you risk. If it's say Oklahoma City versus Dallas, the two sides might be OKC -320 (risk $320 to win $100, implying about a 75% chance of winning) and DAL +260 (risk $100 to win $260).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With spread bets, both sides have an equal chance of winning, and are usually priced the same. But with money lines, the gambler doesn't know the true odds, so they don't know the vig they're paying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is data to suggest that underdogs pay more in vig, and are therefore more profitable for the sportsbook. This is called the &lt;a href="https://www.football-data.co.uk/blog/favourite_longshot_bias_revisited.php"&gt;favorite-longshot bias&lt;/a&gt; -- conventional betting wisdom is the expected value of taking an underdog money line bet (especially a big underdog) is lower than taking the favorite. People who bet the underdog are in essence paying a premium to have a more thrilling outcome if they do win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's a documented phenomenon in &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3271248"&gt;horse racing&lt;/a&gt;, there's &lt;a href="https://www.pinnacle.com/betting-resources/en/betting-strategy/why-the-favourite-longshot-bias-is-not-a-bias/qjb2prcq4q96nftd"&gt;some debate as to whether it exists&lt;/a&gt; in general, so I analyzed the 4,634 games with money line betting data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If somebody always bet the favorite on every NBA game, or the underdog, what would be their rate of return?  Is it better or worse than the -4.5% rate on spread bets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did find evidence of the favorite-longshot bias in the NBA money lines. When risking a constant amount of money on each bet, underdogs had a rate of return of -5.47% versus -4.09% for favorites.  Favorites between -200 and -400 offer the best rate of return of any type of money line bet, at -2.97%. Every single type of underdog bet does worse than -4.5% of the typical spread bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;label&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;start&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;end&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;num games&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;return %&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;all faves&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-9999&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4839&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-4.09%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;mild faves&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-200&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2174&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-4.19%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;heavy faves&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-400&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-200&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1612&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-2.97%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;huge faves&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-9999&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-400&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1053&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-5.59%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;all dogs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9999&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4634&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-5.47%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;mild dogs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;200&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2440&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-5.60%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;heavy dogs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;200&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;400&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1430&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-5.69%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;huge dogs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;400&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9999&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;764&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-4.65%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of dogs and favorites aren't equal because some games have money lines where both sides are negative, say -110, like a traditional bet with a spread of zero. There's also a big asymmetry when the odds are long. For instance the favorite might be -800 and the underdog is +561. That doesn't represent a huge vig, it's just a quirk of how American-style odds work (covered in the book).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Caveats and bootstraps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table above isn't telling the whole story. I'm not conveying a sense of the volatility in the rate of return. Huge underdogs have a bigger payout when they do win, so the outcomes are going to be a lot more variable than betting the favorites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-4.65% is the best estimate of the rate of return for huge underdogs, but maybe we just got lucky, or unlucky. A couple of longshot bets winning or losing could drastically change the overall return rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test volatility, I used bootstrapping, &lt;a href="/one-in-e.html"&gt;previously covered in &lt;em&gt;one in e&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I repeatedly randomly sampled 80% (611/764) of the huge underdog bets and calculated the rate of return on that set. Looking at the range of outcomes helps illustrate the variability of these bets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing that 100 times leads to a pretty wide spread of rates of return:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="huge-dog-bootstrap" src="/img/huge-dog-bootstrap.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the mean value is close to the overall mean, 15% of bootstrapped samples actually had a positive rate of return.  This is similar to what we saw in &lt;a href="/cool-parlay-bro.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;cool parlay, bro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where due to variance, even gamblers with no advantage over the house had a small chance of making money over a long period of time off of parlays. I described that situation "like a lottery where you have a 12% chance of winning $3,617, but an 88% chance of losing $10,221." This is a similar proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bridgejumper parlays and p-hacking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd need a lot more data to get a crisp estimate of the rate of return on huge underdogs, but we can have more confidence in the estimated -5.59% rate for huge favorites. Huge favorites being disadvantaged kind of contradicts the favorite-longshot bias theory, but it doesn't surprise me at all due to a strange phenomenon I've seen over and over again online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a type of bet &lt;em&gt;sharps&lt;/em&gt; might call "&lt;a href="https://equinedge.com/glossary/exotic-betting/bridgejumper"&gt;bridgejumper&lt;/a&gt; parlays" and &lt;em&gt;squares&lt;/em&gt; on the internet unironically call "free money parlays" -- a parlay of a whole bunch of heavy favorite money lines together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gambler starts with some heavy favorite they like and keep adding more heavy favorites to the parlay till they get &lt;em&gt;plus odds&lt;/em&gt; (they can win more than they risk), ending up with 5-6 heavy favorites on the same parlay. They will pick legs of the parlay from different sports, if necessary. There usually aren't enough heavy favorites in the NBA on a particular night to get to the magic &amp;gt; +100 payout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example you might see posted on reddit or twitter would be a 6 leg parlay with a payout of +105 like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtics -600&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nuggets -900&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OKC -1000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lakers -600&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duke -600&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some UFC Guy, because they needed a sixth bet -700&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've talked to a couple people who take bridgejumper parlays, and they genuinely seem to think they've found some kind of glitch in the matrix -- all of the legs of the bet have a high chance of winning, therefore the bet is a sure thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sensible person would know that sportsbooks aren't in the business of offering free money so maybe they're missing something. A humble person would assume they probably hadn't discovered some clever trick the sportsbooks don't know about. But most people who get into betting aren't sensible or humble (they think they can see the future, after all), so for a certain class of bettor, this type of wager just &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like a sure thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parlay form, the fallacy seems obvious to me. Just because the individual risk on each leg of the parlay is small, that doesn't mean the combined risk is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a more sophisticated version of this fallacy in statistics called p-hacking. As always, &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/882/"&gt;there's an xkcd about it&lt;/a&gt;. A particular experiment might have a 5% chance of giving a false result. 5% is a pretty small number. But if you do 13 of those experiments, there's about a 50% chance that at least one of them will give a false result. Even people who are good at math and science probably don't have a good sense of what &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(.95^{13}\)&lt;/span&gt; equals. It's sort of like a 13 leg parlay of money line bets at -1900.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time: more on point totals, money lines, and human nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been messing around with prime numbers, because there are several places where they intersect with both &lt;a href="/do-you-wanna-win.html"&gt;random walks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="/riding-the-waves.html"&gt;arcsine distribution&lt;/a&gt;.  It's going to take a while to finally tie that bow, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's a quick one this week: a kinda-cool story, and a kinda-cool graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Random Primes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prime numbers are simple to find, but not easy. They're not randomly distributed, but it's hard to come up with easy ways to find them, and they act like random numbers in certain ways.  Why is 47 prime and 57 non-prime? You can't really tell just by looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the primes, we can write down every number from, say, 1 to 1000. Then we cross out 2, and every number divisible by 2 (4, 6, 8, etc.). Repeat that with 3 (6, 9, 12, etc.), and so on. The numbers left behind are prime. This is the famous &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes"&gt;Sieve of Eratosthenes&lt;/a&gt; -- it's a tedious way to find prime numbers, but it's by far the easiest to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sieve gave mathematician David Hawkins an idea [1]: what about doing that same process, but randomly?  For each number, flip a coin, if it comes up heads, cross the number out. That will eliminate half of the numbers on the first pass. Take the lowest number &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; that remains and eliminate each of the remaining numbers with probability &lt;code&gt;1/k&lt;/code&gt;. Say it's 4. For each remaining number, we flip a 4 sided die and if it comes up 4, we cross it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we go through all the numbers, what's left over won't look like real prime numbers -- there should be as many even fake primes as odd ones, for starters. But the remaining numbers will be as sparse as the actual prime numbers. As the sample size N heads to infinity, the chances of a random number being a real prime, and being a fake prime, are the same -- &lt;code&gt;1/log(N)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a brilliant way to figure out what we know about prime numbers are due to their density, and what are due to other, seemingly more magical (but still non-random) factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several characteristics of real primes apply to the random primes. And tantalizingly, things that can't be proven about real primes can be proven about the fake ones. It's been conjectured that there are infinitely many pairs of twin primes -- primes that are separated by 2 numbers. An example would be 5 and 7, or 11 and 13. It makes sense for a lot of reasons that there should be an infinite number of twin primes.  But mathematicians have been trying to prove it for over 150 years, without success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random primes can be odd or even, so the analogy to twin primes would be two random primes that are only one apart, say 5 and 6. It's relatively simple to prove that there are an infinite number of random twin primes [2]. That could easily be fool's gold -- treating the primes like they're randomly distributed gives mathematicians a whole toolbox of statistical techniques to use on them, but they're not random, or arbitrary. They're perfectly logical, and yet still inscrutible, hidden in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Largest prime factors of composite numbers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was intrigued by the largest prime factor of composite (non-prime) numbers. Are there any patterns?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As background, every number can be split into a unique set of prime factors. For instance, the number 24 can be factored into &lt;code&gt;24 = 8 * 3 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3&lt;/code&gt;. Let's say we knock off the biggest prime factor. We get: &lt;code&gt;2 * 2 * 2 = 8&lt;/code&gt;. The raw numbers rapidly get too big, so I looked at the log of the ratio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/logratios100k.png" src="/img/logratios100k.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red curve is the distribution of the first 100,000 composite numbers, the orange is the next 100,000 composite numbers, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we bump up an order of magnitude? This time, the red curve is the first million composite numbers, the orange is the next million, and so on. Here's what that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/logratios1M.png" src="/img/logratios1M.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much the same graph, right? The X axis is different, but the shapes are very similar to the first one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go another order of magnitude up. The first 10,000,000 versus the next 10,000,000, and so on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/logratios10M.png" src="/img/logratios10M.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get the same basic shapes again! The self-similarity is kinda cool. Is it possible to come up with some function for the distribution for this quantity? You tell me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The perils of interpolation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These graphs are flawed. I'm generating these graphs using Kernel Density Estimation, a technique for visualizing the density of data. Histograms, another common way, can be misleading. The choice of bin size can radically alter what the histogram looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But KDE can also be misleading. These graphs make it look like the curve starts at zero.  That's not true. The minimum possible value happens when a number is of the form &lt;code&gt;2*p&lt;/code&gt;, where p is a prime -- the value will be &lt;code&gt;log(2)&lt;/code&gt;, about .693.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data is actually way &lt;em&gt;chunkier&lt;/em&gt; than KDE is treating it.  Every point of data is the log of a whole number. So there aren't that many unique values. For instance, between 0 and 1 on the X axis, there's only one possible value -- &lt;code&gt;log(2)&lt;/code&gt;. Between 1 and 3, there are only 18 possible values, &lt;code&gt;log(2)&lt;/code&gt; thru &lt;code&gt;log(19)&lt;/code&gt; -- those being the only integers with a &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt; less than 3 and greater than 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes it hard to visualize the data accurately. There are too many possible values to display each one individually, but not enough for KDE's smoothing to be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;kernel&lt;/em&gt; in Kernel Density Estimation is the algorithm used to smooth the data --  it's basically a moving average that assumes something about the distribution of the data. People usually use the Gaussian kernel, which treats the data like a normal distribution -- smooth and bell curvy. A better choice for chunky data is the &lt;em&gt;tophat&lt;/em&gt; kernel, which treats the space between points like a uniform distribution -- in other words, a flat line. If the sparseness of the data on the X axis were due to a small sample size, the tophat kernel would display plateaus that aren't in the real data. But here, I calculated data for the first 100 Million numbers, so there's no lack of data. The sparseness of the data is by construction. &lt;code&gt;log(2)&lt;/code&gt; will be the only value between 0 and 1, no matter how many numbers we go up to. So the left side of the graph &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; look fairly chunky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tophat kernel does a much better job of conveying the non-smoothness of the distribution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Think of a number&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick a number between 1-100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say I write down the numbers from 1-100 on pieces of paper and put them in a big bag, and randomly select from them. After every selection, I put the paper back in the bag, so the same number can get picked more than once.  If I do that 100 times, what is the chance of your number being chosen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The math isn't too tricky. It's often easier to calculate the chances of a thing not happening, then subtract that from 1, to get the chances of the thing happening. There's a 99/100 chance your number doesn't get picked each time. So the probability of never getting selected is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((99/100)^{100} = .366\)&lt;/span&gt;. Subtract that from one, and there's a 63.4% chance your number will be chosen. Alternately, we'd expect to get 634 unique numbers in 1000 selections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I start picking numbers, there's a low chance of getting a duplicate, but that increases as I go along. On my second pick, there's only a 1/100 chance of getting a duplicate. But if I'm near the end and have gotten 60 uniques so far, there's a 60/100 chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's kind of a self-correcting process. Every time I pick a unique number, it increases the odds of getting a duplicate on the next pick. Each pick is independent, but the likelihood of getting a duplicate is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could choose the numbers by flipping a biased coin that comes up heads 63.4% of the time for each one instead. I will get the same number of values on average, and they will be randomly chosen, but the count of values will be much more variable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/distinct-binomial.png" src="/img/distinct-binomial.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if the goal is to select exactly 63 items out of 100, the best way would be to randomly select 63 without replacement so there is no variation in the number of items selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A number's a number&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of selecting 100 times from 100 numbers, what if we selected a bajillion times from a bajillion numbers? To put it in math terms, what is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} (\frac{n-1}{n})^{n}\)&lt;/span&gt; ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out this is equal to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{1}{e}\)&lt;/span&gt; ! Yeah, e! Your old buddy from calculus class. You know, the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(e^{i\pi}\)&lt;/span&gt; guy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As n goes to infinity, the probability of a number being selected is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1-\frac{1}{e} = .632\)&lt;/span&gt;. This leads to a technique called bootstrapping, or ".632 selection" in machine learning (back to that in a minute).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Don't think of an answer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the chances that a number gets selected exactly once? Turns out, it's &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{1}{e}\)&lt;/span&gt;, same as the chances of not getting selected! This was surprising enough to me to bother to work out the proof, given at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means the chances of a number getting selected more than once is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1 - \frac{2}{e}\)&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/e (36.8%) of numbers don't get selected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/e (36.8%) get selected exactly once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-2/e (26.4%) get selected 2+ times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before, the variance in number of items picked 2+ times is much lower than flipping a coin that comes up heads 26.4% of the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/more-than-once.png" src="/img/more-than-once.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Derangements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say I'm handing out coats randomly after a party. What are the chances that nobody gets their own coat back? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called a derangement, and the probability is also 1/e. An almost correct way to think about this is the chance of each person not getting their own coat (or each coat not getting their own person, depending on your perspective) is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{(x-1)}{x}\)&lt;/span&gt; and there are &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; coats, so the chances of a derangement are &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{x-1}{x}^{x}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is wrong because each round isn't independent. In the first case, we were doing selection with replacement, so a number being picked one round doesn't affect its probability of being picked next round.  That's not the case here. Say we've got the numbers 1 thru 4. To make a derangement, the first selection can be 2, 3 or 4. The second selection can be 1, 3 or 4. But 3 or 4 might have been picked in the first selection and can't be chosen again. 2/3rds of the time, there will only be two options for the second selection, not three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rencontres_numbers"&gt;long way 'round the mountain&lt;/a&gt; involves introducing a new mathematical function called the subfactorial, denoted as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(!x\)&lt;/span&gt;, which is equal to the integer closest to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{x!}{e}\)&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(e\)&lt;/span&gt; gets in there because in the course of counting the number of possible derangements, a series is produced that converges to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1/e\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of derangements for a set of size x is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(!x\)&lt;/span&gt; and the number of permutations is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x!\)&lt;/span&gt;, so the probability of a derangement as x gets big is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{!x}{x!} = \frac{1}{e}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the chances of only one person getting their coat back? It's also &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{1}{e}\)&lt;/span&gt;, just like the chances of a number getting selected exactly once when drawing numbers with replacement.  The number of fixed points -- number of people who get their own coat back -- follows a Poisson distribution with mean 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second process seems very different from the first one. It is selection with replacement versus without replacement. But &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(e\)&lt;/span&gt; is sort of the horizon line of mathematics -- a lot of things tend towards it (or its inverse) in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bootstrapping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say we're working on a typical statistics/machine learning problem. We're given some training data where we already know the right answer, and we're trying to predict for future results. There are a ton of ways we could build a model. Which model will do the best on the unknown data, and how variable might the accuracy be? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bootstrapping is a way to answer those questions. A good way to estimate how accurate a model will be in the future is to train it over and over with different random subsets of the training data, and see how accurate the model is on the data that was held out. That will give a range of accuracy scores which can be used to estimate how well the model will be on new inputs, where we don't know the answers ahead of time. If the model we're building has a small set of parameters we're fitting (like the coefficients in a linear regression), we can also estimate a range of plausible values for those parameters. If that range is really wide, it indicates a certain parameter isn't that important to the model, because it doesn't matter if it's big or small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bootstrapping is a way of answering those questions, using the process described before -- if we have x datapoints, pick x numbers without replacement x times. The ones that get selected at least once are used to train the models, and the ones that don't get selected are used to generate an estimate of accuracy on unseen data. We can do that over and over again and get different splits every time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a fine way to split up the training data and the validation data to generate a range of plausible accuracy scores, but I couldn't find a good reason other than tradition for doing it that way. The 63.2/36.8 split isn't some magical value. Instead of having the numbers that weren't picked be the holdout group, we could instead leave out the numbers that were only picked once (also 1/e of the numbers), and train on the ones not selected or selected more than once. But picking 63% of values (or some other percentage) without replacement is the best way to do it, in my opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://sites.stat.washington.edu/courses/stat527/s14/readings/ann_stat1979.pdf"&gt;original paper&lt;/a&gt; doesn't give any statistical insight into why the choice was made, but a remark at the end says, "it is remarkably easy to implement on the computer", and notes the $4 cost of running the experiments on Stanford's &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/history/system-370"&gt;IBM 370/168 mainframe&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe it's just the engineer in me, but it seems like a goofy way to do things, unless you actually want a variable number of items selected each run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the notebook, I showed that bootstrapping is about 40% slower than selection without replacement when using numpy's &lt;a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.choice.html"&gt;choice()&lt;/a&gt; function. However, the cost of selecting which items to use for training vs. testing should be insignificant compared to the cost of actually training the models using that train/test split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A chance encounter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick proof of the chances of being selected exactly once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing x selections with replacement, the chance of a number being chosen as the very first selection (and no other times) is 
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{1}{x} * \frac{x-1}{x}^{x-1}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are x possible positions for a number to be selected exactly once. Multiply the above by x, which cancels out 1/x. So the chances of a number being selected exactly once at any position is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((\frac{x-1}{x})^{x-1}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's try to find a number &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(q\)&lt;/span&gt; so that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\lim\limits_{x\to\infty} (\frac{x-1}{x})^{x-1} = e^{q}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the log of both sides:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(q = \lim\limits_{x\to\infty} (x-1) * log(\frac{x-1}{x}) = \lim\limits_{x\to\infty} \frac{log(\frac{x-1}{x})}{1/(x-1)}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let 
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f(x) = log(\frac{x-1}{x})\)&lt;/span&gt;
and 
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g(x) = \frac{1}{x-1}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By L'Hopital's rule, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\lim\limits_{x\to\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim\limits_{x\to\infty}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivative of a log of a function is the derivative of the function divided by the function itself, so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} log(\frac{x-1}{x}) = \frac{d}{dx} log(1 - \frac{1}{x}) = \frac{\frac{d}{dx}(1-\frac{1}{x})}{1-\frac{1}{x}} =\frac{\frac{1}{x^{2}}}{{1-\frac{1}{x}}} = \frac{1}{x^{2}-x} = \frac{1}{x(x-1)}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(g'(x) = \frac{-1}{(x-1)^{2}}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canceling out (x-1) from both, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = \frac{1}{x}  * \frac{x-1}{-1} = -1 * \frac{x-1}{x}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(q = \lim\limits_{x\to\infty} -1 * \frac{x-1}{x} = -1\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the limit, the probability of being selected exactly once is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(e^{-1} = \frac{1}{e}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to return to the subject of sports betting this week. Let's start with something easy. How do you avoid going broke betting on sports? That's easy. Reduce your bet size to zero. Scared money don't lose none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as there is randomness, there will be outliers and unexpected results. It is impossible to escape randomness in sports betting. Any time you decide to bet, you enter the kingdom of randomness and have to abide by its laws. It doesn't matter whether you have an advantage over the house (unless the advantage is truly massive). Nothing is guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty hard thing for us to know how to deal with, when our brains are pattern-finding machines. Our brains will find patterns to give us a sense of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talk about "win rate" a bunch below. That means the percent of the time a gambler can win bets at even odds (such as a standard spread bet on the NBA or NFL.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The random walks shown below are a little different from a standard one, because I'm simulating the vig. The walker goes 1 block north when the coin comes up heads (or they win the bet), and 1.1 blocks south when the coin comes up tails (or they lose the bet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In the marches of madness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCAA holds the March Madness tournament every year to determine who the best college basketball team is. It's a single elimination tournament of 64 teams, arranged into a big bracket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say we do a March Madness style bracket with coin flippers instead of basketball teams. We randomly assign them places in the bracket. For each matchup, the coin flipper at the top of the matchup flips a coin. If they get heads, they survive and advance. If they get tails, they lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody's going to go 6-0 and win that tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine we expanded that to every single person on the planet. Every single person gets matched up into a 64 person bracket, then each of those winners get added to another 64 team bracket, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, someone has to emerge the victor with a 32-0 record or something -- the greatest coin flipper in the world. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Random walks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine going on a walk. Every time you get to an intersection, you flip a coin. If it's heads, you go one block north and one block east. If it's tails, you go one block south and one block east. This is called a random walk. It's a bit like a gambler's profits or losses plotted on a graph as a function of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there's a huge value in knowing what random walks look like. Do they remind you of anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/rw0.5.png" src="/img/rw0.5.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Touts are people who sell recommendations about which bets to take. Pay $30 and they'll tell you which side to bet on the big game tonight. (I have a whole section about touts in the book.) The best tout I could find has had pretty steady success for nearly 20 years, with a win rate of 54.1% against the standard vig.  That's statistically significant, but it's not enough to guarantee success moving forwards. Even if they continue to place bets that should win 54.1% of the time -- they're flipping a slightly biased coin -- that doesn't mean they'll make money on those bets. Let's look at some random walks at 54.1% win rate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/rw0.541.png" src="/img/rw0.541.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the random walks ended up around 50 units after 1000 bets, which is pretty good. Two of them made a tiny bit of money. The other four lost money. This is a small sample size, but a 44% chance of losing money after paying for 1,000 picks at $30 a pop isn't great. (More info on the economics of touts in the book.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The touts I looked at generally don't sell picks for every single game. So with 1200 games in an NBA season, this could be several years' worth of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine all of these as 9 different touts, with the exact same level of skill at picking games. But some of them look like geniuses, and some look like bozos. There would probably be some selection bias. The ones with the bad records would drop out -- who's buying their picks if they're losing money?  And the ones who did better than their true skill level of 54.1% would be more likely to stick with it. Yet all these random walks were generated with the same 54.1% win rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you bought 1,000 picks from this tout, you don't get to choose which of the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(2^{1000} = (2^{10})^{100} \approx 10^{300}\)&lt;/span&gt; possible random walks you will actually get. If each bet has a 54.1% chance of winning, there's no guarantee you will have exactly 541 wins and 459 losses at the end of 1000 bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what someone who is right 60% of the time looks like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/rw0.6.png" src="/img/rw0.6.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success is pretty boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always said it's much harder to learn from success than from failure. At a 60% win rate, none of them really have long cold streaks, just small breaks between hot streaks. It wouldn't be interesting to tell stories about those graphs. There's nothing to learn, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think it's possible to win 60% against the spread, based on what are called push charts, discussed in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphs at the 54.1% success rate appear a lot more human. They have hot and cold streaks, swoons, periods where they seem stuck in a range of values. Some of them &lt;em&gt;scuffled the whole time&lt;/em&gt;, a couple &lt;em&gt;finally got locked in near the end&lt;/em&gt;, a couple were &lt;em&gt;consistently good&lt;/em&gt;. Some had good years, some had bad years. Even though they are randomly generated, they look like they have more to teach us, like they offer more opportunities to tell stories. But they all have the exact same win rate, or level of skill at handicapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No outcome is guaranteed, but the higher the win rate, the more consistently the graph is going to go up and to the right at a steady pace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, here are some walks at 52.4% win rate, the break-even point. Most results end up close to zero after 1000 bets, but there is always a possibility of an extended run towards the positive or negative side -- it happened 4/9 times in this sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/rw0.524.png" src="/img/rw0.524.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Axe Forgets, The Tree Remembers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If those 9 graphs were stock prices, which one would you consider the best investment? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we know they're equally bad investments. They're winning just enough to break even, but not make profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They all have the same Expected Value moving forwards. Previous results are meaningless and have no bearing on whether the next step will be up or down. Every step is the start of an entirely new random walk. The coin doesn't remember what has happened in the past. We do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what's known in math as a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(probability_theory)"&gt;Martingale&lt;/a&gt;, named after a betting system that was popular in France hundreds of years ago. (I previously talked about Martingales in the series on the hot hand.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea behind all these betting systems is to &lt;em&gt;chase&lt;/em&gt; losses by betting more when you're losing. Hopefully it's obvious that these chase systems are crazy, though formally proving it led to a lot of interesting math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fallacy and ruin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though chase systems are irrational, they've persisted through the centuries. Human beings are wired to be semi-rational -- we use previous data to try and predict the future, but we use it even when the data was randomly generated, and even when we don't have a significant amount of data. We need coherent stories to tell about why things happened. There is no rational reason to believe in a chase system, but I think there are semi-rational reasons to fall prey to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy"&gt;the gambler's fallacy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope these random walks show that having a modest, plausible advantage over the house isn't a guarantee of success, even over a really long timespan. Positive Expected Value is necessary, but not sufficient, for making money long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of gamblers bet with negative expected value due to the vig, and possibly biases in the lines against &lt;em&gt;public teams&lt;/em&gt;, as we saw in a previous installment. If each bet the average gambler makes has a negative expected value, they can't fix that by betting MORE.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If I keep doubling down, eventually I'll win it all back." Maybe if you have infinite capital and unlimited time. Otherwise the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_ruin"&gt;Gambler's Ruin&lt;/a&gt; is certain. The market can stay liquid longer than you can stay irrational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maximizing profits: the Kelly criterion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say a bettor really does have an edge over the house -- they can beat the spreads on NBA basketball 56% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with that advantage, it's easy to go broke betting too much at once. Suppose they bet 25% of their bankroll on each bet.  What happens after 200 bets?  200 bets is not a lot, roughly 1 month of NBA games if they bet on every game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in a blue moon they end up a big winner, but 53% of the time the gambler is left with less than 5% of their bankroll after 200 bets even though they have a pretty healthy advantage over the house. So it's still a game of chance rather than skill, even though it would require a lot of mental labor to make the picks, and time to actually bet the picks. The mean rate of return is quite impressive (turning $100 into $4,650), but the median result is bankruptcy (turning $100 into $3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, there has to be some connection between the betting advantage and the optimal amount to risk on each bet. If a gambler only has a tiny advantage, they should only be making tiny bets as a percentage of their total bankroll. The better they are, the more they can risk. And if they have no advantage, they shouldn't bet real money at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That intuition is correct. The Kelly criterion gives a formula for the exact percent of the bankroll to risk on each bet in order to maximize Expected Value, given a certain level of advantage. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the Kelly criterion says to bet 7.6% of the total bankroll on each bet.  I did 100,000 simulations of a sequence of 200 bets following the Kelly criterion. The gambler only went broke around one time in 1,000, which is much better. The median result was turning $100 into $168, which is pretty good. However, the gambler still lost money 31% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just one month of betting, assuming the gambler bets on every NBA game. Losing money 31% of the time seems pretty high for what's supposed to be the optimal way to bet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about a longer period of time? I simulated 1,000 bets this time, nearly a whole season of the NBA. The median outcome is turning $100 into $1356, which is a sweet rate of return. But the chances of going broke actually increased! The player will go broke 1.4% of the time, about 11x more often on 1000 bets than 200, which seems unfair, but the Kelly criterion doesn't make any guarantees about not going broke. It just offers the way to optimize Expected Value if the gambler knows the exact advantage they have over the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Partial Kelly Betting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly Betting is the optimal way to maximize profits, but what about lower stakes? The real power of Kelly betting is its compounding nature -- as the bankroll gets bigger or smaller, the bet size scales up or down as well. It also corresponds to our incorrect intuitive understanding of randomness -- it makes sense someone should bet smaller amounts when they're on a &lt;em&gt;cold streak&lt;/em&gt;, and larger amounts when they're on a &lt;em&gt;hot streak&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the gambler only bets 2% of their bankroll instead of the 7.6% recommended by the Kelly criterion? They don't go broke a single time in 100,000 simulations of 1,000 bets.  The mean rate of return is 4.6x and the median is 3.7x. That's a pretty nice return on investment, relative to the risk. The gambler still lost money 2.8% of the time, though. Being conservative, betting a lot of games at positive expected value, and betting the right way greatly increase the chances of success, but nothing can eliminate the possibility of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine doing 1000 bets at 56% win percentage and a conservative bet size, and still losing money. Wild, isn't it? If you take one thing away from this article, it should be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Failure is always an option.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Betting a constant amount&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You wouldn't have that problem with betting a constant amount, right? Say a gambler has a bankroll of $100 and bets to win $20 on each game. 1000 games, 56 win %.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Expected Value of playing this way doesn't have any randomness in it. It's just a simple algebra problem. According to EV, they should end up with $252 at the end of the season, for a profit of $152. Nice. But as I've mentioned before, EV says nothing about the range of possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I actually simulate it, a pretty wide range of outcomes are possible. 99% of the time, the gambler makes money, but 6 times out of 100,000, they lose everything and more. (6 in 100,000 is about the same odds as winning a 14 leg parlay.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With betting a fixed size, the rate of return is lower and the risk of going broke doesn't go away. So it's sub-optimal compared to Kelly-style betting with a very small percentage of the total bankroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notebook: &lt;a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/csdurfee.github.io/blob/main/harmonics.ipynb"&gt;https://github.com/csdurfee/csdurfee.github.io/blob/main/harmonics.ipynb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was gonna do random walks this week, but the thing about random walks is you don't know where you're gonna end up, and I ended up back at last week's topic again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time, we saw that the sine wave, sawtooth wave and square wave produced very different distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three waveforms are used in electronic music, and they all have different acoustic properties. A sine wave sounds like a "boop" -- think of the sound they play to censor someone who says a swear word on the TV.  That's a sine wave with a frequency of 1000Hz. Sawtooth waves are extremely buzzy. A square wave has, ironically, kind of a round sound, at least as far as how it gets used in electronic music.  A good example is the bass line to this week's song. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not a pure square wave, and it's rare to ever hear pure sawtooth or square waves because they're harsh on the ears. Usually multiple waveforms are combined together and then passed through various filters and effects -- in other words, synthesized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much every sound you've ever heard is a mix of different frequencies. Only sine waves are truly pure, just a single frequency. I tried looking for an actual musical instrument that produces pure sine waves, and the closest thing (according to the internet, at least) is a tuning fork. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any other musical instrument, or human voice, or backfiring car, will produce overtones. There's one note that is perceived as the &lt;em&gt;fundamental frequency&lt;/em&gt;, but every sound is kind of like a little chord when the overtones are included. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For musical instruments, the loudest overtones are generally at frequencies that are a multiple of the original frequency. These overtones are called &lt;em&gt;harmonics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if I play a note at 400 Hz on a guitar, it will also produce harmonics at 800 Hz (2x the fundamental frequency), 1200 Hz (3x), 1600 Hz (4x), 2000 Hz (5x), and so on. This corresponds to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics)"&gt;harmonic series in mathematics&lt;/a&gt;. It's the sum of the ratios of the wavelengths of the harmonics to the fundamental frequency: 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The clarinet is the squarest instrument&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played the clarinet in grade school and I am the biggest dork on the planet, so it's certainly metaphorically true. But it's also literally true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot that goes into exactly which overtones get produced by a physical instrument, but most instruments put out the whole series of harmonics. &lt;a href="https://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/clarinetacoustics.html#harmonics"&gt;The clarinet is different&lt;/a&gt;. Because of a clarinet's physical shape, it pretty much only produces odd harmonics. So, in our example, 400 Hz, 1200 Hz, 2000 Hz, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The square wave is like an idealized version of a clarinet -- it also only puts out odd harmonics. This is a result of how a square wave is constructed. In the real world, they're formed out of a combination of sine waves. Which sine waves? You guessed it -- the ones that correspond to the odd harmonic frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the fundamental frequency combined with the 3rd harmonic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/square3.png" src="/img/square3.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It already looks a bit square-wavey. Additional harmonics make the square parts a bit more square.  Here's what it looks like going up to the 19th harmonic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/square21.png" src="/img/square21.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the real world, we can only add a finite number of harmonics, but if we could combine an infinite number of them, we would get the ideal square wave. This is called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series"&gt;Fourier series&lt;/a&gt; of the square wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an illustration to help show how the square wave gets built up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/square-buildup.png" src="/img/square-buildup.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red wave is the fundamental frequency. The orange square-ish wave is the result of combining the other colored waves with the red wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sum normally would be scaled up a bit (multiplied by 4/pi), but it's easier without the scaling to see how the other waves sort of hammer the fundamental frequency into the shape of the square wave. At some points they are pushing it up, and other points pulling it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this graph makes it clearer. The red is the fundamental, the yellow is the sum of all the other harmonics, and the orange is the combination of the two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/combine-harmonics-square.png" src="/img/combine-harmonics-square.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the yellow is above the X axis, it's pulling the fundamental frequency up, and where it's below, it's pulling the fundamental down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The sawtooth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sawtooth wave is what you get when you combine all the harmonics, odd and even. Like the square wave, it starts to take its basic shape right away. Here's the fundamental plus the second harmonic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/sawtooth2.png" src="/img/sawtooth2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here it is going all the way up to the 10th harmonic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red fundamental plus yellow harmonics produce the orange sawtooth wave:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/combine-harmonics-saw.png" src="/img/combine-harmonics-saw.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time, I talked about the sawtooth wave producing a uniform distribution of amplitudes -- the butter gets spread evenly over the toast. The graph above isn't a very smooth stroke of butter. It's not steadily decreasing, particularly at the ends. Here's what the distribution looks like at this point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/sawtooth10-amps.png" src="/img/sawtooth10-amps.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an infinite series of harmonics, that graph will even out to a uniform distribution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting even&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about only the even harmonics? Is that a thing? Not in the natural world as far as I know, but there's nothing stopping me from making one. (It wouldn't be the worst musical crime I've ever committed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what a combo of just the even harmonics looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/even-harmonics.png" src="/img/even-harmonics.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a little code from the pygame project, it's easy to turn that waveform into a sound file. It sounds like an angry computer beep, with a little flutter mixed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/audio/evens_clean.wav" target="_blank"&gt;Here's an audio sample&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In my prime&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HarmonicSeriesofPrimes.html"&gt;harmonic series of primes&lt;/a&gt; is what it sounds like: the harmonic series, but just the prime numbers: 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 + 1/11 + 1/13 + ....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it's important in mathematics, I don't have a good musical reason to do this. But if you can throw the prime numbers into something, you gotta do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a sound, I kinda like it. It's nice and throaty. &lt;a href="/audio/primes.wav" target="_blank"&gt;Here's what it sounds like.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't really sound like a sawtooth wave or a square wave to me. Here's the waveform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/prime-waveform.png" src="/img/prime-waveform.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what the distribution of amplitudes looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/prime-amp.png" src="/img/prime-amp.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dissonance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the overtones of the harmonic series don't correspond with the 12 notes of the modern western musical scale (called 12 tone equal temprament, or 12TET). The first 4 harmonics of the series are nice and clean, but after that they get weird. Each harmonic in the series is smaller in amplitude than the previous one, so it has less of an effect on the shape of the final wave. So the dissonance is there, but it's way in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prime number bloop I made above should be extra &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;. The 2nd and 3rd harmonics are included, so those will sound nice, but after that they are at least a little off the standard western scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say we're playing the &lt;em&gt;prime bloop&lt;/em&gt; at A4 (the standard pitch used for tuning).  Here's how the harmonics work out. A cent is 1% of a semitone. So a note that is off by 50 cents is right between two notes on the 12 tone scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;harmonic #&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;frequency&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;pitch&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;error&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;440 Hz&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;880 Hz&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1320&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;E6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;+2 cents&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2200&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C#7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-14 cents&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3080&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;G7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;+31 cents&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4840&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;D#8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-49 cents&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5720&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;F8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;+41 cents&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7480&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A#8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;+5 cents&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note the 3rd harmonic, E6, is a little &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; in 12TET, despite being a &lt;em&gt;perfect fifth&lt;/em&gt; -- an exact 3:2 ratio with the A5.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Harmonics aren't everything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's true that any audio can be decomposed into a bunch of sine waves, the fundamental frequency and the harmonics aren't really what gives an instrument its unique timbre. It's hundreds or thousands of tiny overtones that don't line up with the harmonics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the spectra of two different piano sounds playing at 220 Hz. One is a somewhat fake piano sound (Fruity DX10), the other a natural, rich sounding one (LABS Soft Piano, which you might've heard before if you listen to those "Lofi Hip Hop Beats to Doomscroll/Not Study To" playlists). Can you guess which is which?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/real-piano.png" src="/img/real-piano.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/fake-piano.png" src="/img/fake-piano.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer may surprise you. I mean, it can't be that surprising since there are only 2 options. But I'd probably get it wrong, if I didn't already know which is which.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending several weeks in the degenerate world of sports gambling, I figured we should go get some fresh air in the land of pure statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Abnormal Distribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody knows what the normal distribution looks like, even if they don't know it as such. You know, the bell curve? The one from the memes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In traditional statistics, the One Big Thing you need to know is called the Central Limit Theorem. It says, if you collect some data and take the average of it, that average (the sample mean) will behave in nice, predictable ways. It's the basis of basically all experimental anything.  If you take a bunch of random samples and calculate the sample mean over and over again, those sample means will look like a normal distribution, if the sample sizes are big enough. That makes it possible to draw big conclusions from relatively small amounts of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How big is "big enough"? Well, it partly depends on the shape of the data being sampled from. If the data itself is distributed like a normal distribution, it makes sense that the sample means would also be normally shaped. It takes a smaller sample size to get the sampling distributions looking like a normal distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a lot of things in life are normally distributed, some of them aren't. The uniform distribution is when every possible outcome is equally likely. Rolling a single die, for instance. 1-6 are all equally likely. Imagine we're trying to estimate the mean value for rolling a standard 6 sided die. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clever way would be to team up sets of sides - 6 goes with 1, 5 goes with 2, 4 goes with 3. Clearly the mean value has to be 3.5, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A less clever way would be to roll a 6 sided die a bunch of times and take the average. We could repeat that process, and track all of these averages. If the sample size is big enough, those averages will make a nice bell curve, with the center at 3.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uniform distribution is sort of obnoxious if you want to calculate the sample mean. The normal distribution, and a lot of other distributions, have a big peak in the middle and tail off towards the edges. If you pick randomly from one of these distributions, it's far more likely to be close to the middle than it is to be far from the middle. With the uniform distribution, every outcome is equally likely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/uniform.png" src="/img/uniform.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couldn't we do even worse than the uniform distribution, though? What if the tails/outliers were even higher than the center? When I first learned about the Central Limit Theorem, I remember thinking about that - how could you define a distribution to be the most obnoxious one possible? The normal distribution is like a frowny face. The Uniform distribution is like a "not impressed" face. Couldn't we have a smiley face distribution to be the anti-normal distribution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Waveforms and probabilities.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All synthesizers in electronic music use a mix of different types of simple waveforms. The sublime &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TB-303"&gt;TB-303&lt;/a&gt; synth line in the song at the top is very simple. The TB-303 a monophonic synth -- a single sawtooth wave (or square wave) with a bunch of filters on top that, in the right hands, turn it from buzzy electronic noise to an emotionally expressive instrument, almost like a digitial violin or human voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking about what probability distributions based on different types of waveforms would look like. How likely is the waveform to be at each amplitude?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the sawtooth waveform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/sawtooth.png" src="/img/sawtooth.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we randomly sample from this wave (following a uniform distribution -- all numbers on the x axis are equally likely) and record the y value, then plot the values as a histogram, what would it look like? Think of it like we put a piece of toast on the Y axis of the graph, the X axis is time. How will the butter be distributed? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be a flat line, like the Uniform distribution, since each stroke of butter is at a constant rate. We're alternating between a very fast wipe and a slower one, but in both cases, it doesn't spend any more time on one section of bread than another because it's a straight line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advanced breakfast techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A square wave spends almost no time in the middle of the bread, so nearly all the butter will be at the edges. That's not a very interesting graph. What about a sine wave?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sawtooth wave always has a constant slope, so the butter is evenly applied. With the sine wave, the slope changes over time. Because of that, the butter knife ends up spending more time at the extreme ends of the bread, where the slope is shallow, compared to the middle of the bread. The more vertical the slope, the faster the knife passes over that bit of bread, and the less butter it gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we sample a bunch of values from the sine wave and plot their Y values as a histogram, we'll get something that looks like a smiley face -- lots of butter near the edges, less butter near the center of the toast. Or perhaps, in tribute to Ozzy, the index and pinky fingers of someone throwing the devil horns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/arcsine-from-sine.png" src="/img/arcsine-from-sine.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a perfectly valid buttering strategy in my book. The crust near the edges tends to be drier, and so can soak up more butter. You actually want to go a bit thinner in the middle, to maintain the structural integrity of the toast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This distribution of butter forms a probability distribution called the arcsine distribution. It's an anti-normal distribution -- fat in the tails, skinny in the middle. A "why so serious?" distribution the Joker might appreciate. The mean is the least likely value, rather than the most likely value. And yet, the Central Limit Theorem still holds. The mean of even a fairly small number of values will behave like a Normal distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are 1,000 iterations of an average of two samples from the arcsine distribution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/arcsin-approx-2.png" src="/img/arcsin-approx-2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And averages of 5 samples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/arcsin-approx-5.png" src="/img/arcsin-approx-5.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And 30 samples at a time. Notice how the x range has shrunk down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/arcsin-approx-30.png" src="/img/arcsin-approx-30.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of distributions that produce that U-type shape. They're known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathtub_curve"&gt;bathtub curves&lt;/a&gt;. They come up when plotting the failure rates of devices (or people). For a lot of things, there's an elevated risk of failure near the beginning and the end, with lower risk in the middle. The curve is showing conditional probability -- for an iPhone to fail on day 500, it has to have not failed on the first 499 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/Bathtub_curve.svg" src="/img/Bathtub_curve.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Particle man vs triangle man&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Uniform distribution isn't really that ab-Normal. It's flat, but it's very malleable. It turns into the normal distribution almost instantly. The symmetry helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take a single sample from a Uniform distribution over and over again, and plot a histogram, it's going to look flat, because every outcome is equally likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take the sum (or average) of two Uniform random variables, what would that look like? We're going to randomly select two numbers between 0 and 1 and sum them up. The result will be between 0 and 2. But some outcomes will be more likely than others.  The extremes (0 and 2) should be extremely unlikely, right? Both the random numbers would have to be close to 0 for the sum to be, and vice versa. There are a lot of ways to get a sum of 1, though. It could be .9 and .1, or .8 and .2, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look online, you can find many explanations of how to get the PDF of the sum of two Uniform distributions using calculus. (&lt;a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse312/20su/files/student_drive/5.5.pdf"&gt;Here's a good one&lt;/a&gt;). While formal proofs are important, it's not very intuitive. So, here's another way to think of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say we're taking the sum of two dice instead of two Uniform random variables.  We're gonna start with two 4 sided dice. It will be obvious that we can scale the number of faces up, and the pattern will hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the possible combinations of dice? The dice are independent, so each combination is equally likely. Let's write them out by columns according to their totals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1, 1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1,2)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1,3)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1,4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(2,1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(2,2)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(2,3)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(2,4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(3,1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(3,2)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(3,3)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(3,4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(4,1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(4,2)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(4,3)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(4,4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we write all the possibilities out like this, it's gonna look like a trapezoid, whether there are 4 faces on the dice, or 4 bajillion. Each row will have one more column that's blank than the one before, and one column that's on its own off to the right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we consolidate the elements, we're gonna get a big triangle, right? Each column up to the mean will have one more combo, and each column after will have one less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1, 1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1,2)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1,3)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1,4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(2,4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(3,4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(4,4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(2,1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(2,2)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(2,3)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(3,3)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(4,3)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(3,1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(3,2)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(4,2)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(4,1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a slight re-arrangement of values, it's clear the triangle builds up with each extra face we add to the dice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1, 1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1,2)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(2,2)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(2,3)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(3,3)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(3,4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(4,4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results for two 2 sided dice are embedded in the left 3 columns of table, then the results for two 3 sided dice on top of them, then two 4 sided dice. Each additional face will add 2 columns to the right. I'm not gonna formally prove anything, but hopefully it's obvious that it will always make a triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_distribution#Distribution_of_the_mean_of_two_standard_uniform_variables"&gt;triangular distribution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a simulation, calculating the sum of two random uniform variables over and over, and counting their frequencies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/shaggy-triangle.png" src="/img/shaggy-triangle.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;3 is the magic number&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sum (or average) of 3 Uniform random variables looks a whole lot like the normal distribution. The sides of the triangle round out, and we get something more like a bell curve. It's more than a parabola because the slope is changing on the sides. Here's what it looks like in simulation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/shaggy-parabola.png" src="/img/shaggy-parabola.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are three 4 sided dice. It's no longer going up and down by one step per column. The slope is changing as we go up and down the sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notebook has a function to print it for any number of faces and dice. Go crazy if you like, but it quickly becomes illegible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the results of three 12 sided dice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/three-twelves.png" src="/img/three-twelves.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't a Normal distribution, but it sure looks close to one.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Toast triangles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we feed the triangular distribution through the &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt; function? To keep the toast analogy going, I guess we're spreading the butter with a sine wave pattern, but changing how hard we're pressing down on the knife to match the triangular distribution -- slow at first, then ramping up, then ramping down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, if we take the sine of the sum of two uniform random variables (defined from the range of -pi to +pi), we'll get the arcsin distribution again! [2] I don't know if that's surprising or not, but there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Knowing your limits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a problem with the toast analogy. (Well, at least one. There may be more, but I ate the evidence.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probability density function of the arcsine distribution looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes up to infinity at the edges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/arcsine-pdf.png" src="/img/arcsine-pdf.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivative of the &lt;code&gt;arcsin&lt;/code&gt; function is &lt;code&gt;1/sqrt(1-x**2)&lt;/code&gt; which goes to infinity as x approaches 0 or 1. That's what gives the arcsine distribution its shape. That also sort of breaks the toast analogy. Are we putting an infinite amount of butter on the bread for an infinetesimal amount of time at the ends of the bread? You can break your brain thinking about that, but you should feel confident that we put a finite amount of butter on the toast between any two intervals of time. We're always concerned with the defined amount of area underneath the PDF, not the value at a singular point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a histogram of the actual arcsine distribution -- 100,000 sample points put into 1,000 bins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/arcsine-hist.png" src="/img/arcsine-hist.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 9% of the total probability is in the leftmost and rightmost 0.5% of the distribution, so the bins at the edges get really, really tall, but they're also really, really skinny. there's a bound on how big they can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDF (area under the curve of the PDF) of the arcsine distribution is well behaved, but its slope goes to infinity at the very edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/arcsine-cdf.png" src="/img/arcsine-cdf.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One for the road&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sinc()&lt;/code&gt; function is defined as &lt;code&gt;sin(x)/x&lt;/code&gt;. It doesn't lead to a well-known distribution as far as I know, but it looks cool, like the logo of some aerospace company from the 1970's, so here you go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/sinc.png" src="/img/sinc.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I buy a Camaro with that painted on the hood? Yeah, probably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An arcsine of things to come&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arcsine distribution is extremely important in the field of random walks. Say you flip a coin to decide whether to turn north or south every block. How far north or south of where you started will you end up? How many times will you cross the street you started on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I showed with the hot hand research that our intuitions about randomness are bad. When it comes to random walks, I think we do even worse. Certain &lt;em&gt;sensible&lt;/em&gt; things almost never happen, while &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; things happen all the time, and the arcsine distribution explains a lot of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be talking about "the public" in this installment, by which I mean the side of a wager that gets the most number of bets placed on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talk about the vig a lot without explaining it. It's explained in the book, but the short version is on standard bets, a gambler needs to win at least 52.4% of the time against the spread to break even due to needing to risk $110 to win $100. That $10 difference is the vig -- how the sportsbook makes their money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In gambling circles, bets are often framed as &lt;em&gt;Vegas&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;the sharps&lt;/em&gt; versus &lt;em&gt;the public&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Sharp&lt;/em&gt; started out as a term for cheaters -- dishonest bookies setting unfair lines, or &lt;em&gt;card sharps&lt;/em&gt; who win thru deception rather than skill. The meaning has changed a bit over time. In modern parlance, a &lt;em&gt;sharp&lt;/em&gt; is someone who wagers on sports as a game of skill, making money over the long term by placing bets with positive expected value. But the negative connotation persists in popular chatter about gambling. There's something unseemly about using math to decide which bets to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say there's a game between the Lakers and the Charlotte Hornets, and the Hornets win against the spread. &lt;em&gt;The public&lt;/em&gt; lost. What degenerate is betting the Hornets? Sharps, that's who. You'd think &lt;em&gt;the public&lt;/em&gt; wouldn't have a problem with &lt;em&gt;the sharps&lt;/em&gt; -- at least someone won money off &lt;em&gt;Vegas&lt;/em&gt; tonight. Without the &lt;em&gt;sharps&lt;/em&gt;, all the money that the public lost would go to Vegas. But &lt;em&gt;Vegas&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sharps&lt;/em&gt; are often conflated together. It's &lt;em&gt;the public&lt;/em&gt; versus everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems unlikely to me that it's always &lt;em&gt;the public&lt;/em&gt; on one side of the bet and &lt;em&gt;sharps&lt;/em&gt; on the other. The public is still right around 50% of the time, right? They can't be drastically worse than a coin flip, so taking the opposite bets can't be drastically better than a coin flip. That means that &lt;em&gt;sharps&lt;/em&gt; are going to agree with &lt;em&gt;the public&lt;/em&gt; at least some of the time. They might &lt;em&gt;fade the public&lt;/em&gt; (bet the opposite side) more often than they agree with the public, but there's probably a fair amount of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do bettors do against the spread as the season goes on?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the public side do better over time? If records against the spread were random and the lines totally fair, we'd expect the public's winning percentage to bounce around pretty close to 50%, spending about as much time on both sides of the line -- sometimes doing a little better than 50%, sometimes a little worse. Over the course of the season, the public's cumulative record against the spread should get closer and closer to 50%, as the sample variance gets smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the 2024-2025 data. This is the public's winning percentage, graphed as a 100 game moving average:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2024-ma" src="/img/2024-ma.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The white line is the start of the All-Star break. The public was winning well below 50% of their bets until a surge in the 100 or so games before the break, as we can see on the cumulative graph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2024-cumu" src="/img/2024-cumu.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public ended up going 584-614 on the season. Someone taking the public side of every bet against the closing line would have lost 91.4 units on the season, for a 48.75% winning percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yellow line is the break-even point for &lt;em&gt;fading the public&lt;/em&gt; -- taking the non-public side on every bet over the season. Up until that surge before the All Star break, it would've been extremely profitable to do so. Even by the end of the year, the public's win percentage didn't get close to 50%. Someone betting at -105 reduced juice could have made .8 units by fading the public on every single bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public were 369-388 when betting on the favorite, and 215-226 betting on the underdog. They went 293-311 when the away team won, and 291-303 when the home team won. They were bad no matter how you slice it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that's all super weird, it's only one season. My data source (sportsbookreview.com) only has spotty data for the 2023-24 NBA season, but they do have mostly complete data for 2021-22 and 2022-23. (Nothing before that, unfortunately.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2021-22 season&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have data for 1108 out of 1230 regular season games for 2021-22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public went 566-542 on the season, for a loss of 30.2 units, much better than 2024-25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the 100 game moving average:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2021-ma" src="/img/2021-ma.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for a dip in early March, the public did consistently fairly well. Not well enough to make money, but better than 50% win percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the cumulative graph, while fading the public (yellow line) would have been profitable for the first month or so, the graph spends most of the season over the 50% line. However, it never gets over 52.4%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2021-cumu" src="/img/2021-cumu.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2022-23 season&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have data for 1176 off 1230 games in 2022-23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public went 587-589 for the season, for a loss of 61 units on the season. That's remarkably fair, if the vig weren't a factor. Here's the moving average:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2022-ma" src="/img/2022-ma.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the cumulative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2022-cumu" src="/img/2022-cumu.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is similar to the 2023-24 graph, where the public pretty consistently lost a little bit more the 50% of the time, but not often enough to make fading the public a viable strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Are team records against the spread random?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to answer this last time, but didn't have time to go deeper. If betting records are random, previous performance gives no information about future performance. Each game is like a coin flip, with equal chances of heads and tails. Teams will have good or bad records against the spread due to chance alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I gave some plausible reasons why this might not be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to test this I could think of was comparing records against the spread in the 1st half of the season to the 2nd half of the season. If the records are random, there should be no correlation between 1st half and 2nd half records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found there was a positive correlation between 1st half and 2nd half records in all three seasons I have data for. In 2023-24, the correlation coefficient was .10. In 2022-23, it was .40, and in 2021-22 it was .27. Only 2022-23 was statistically significant. Assuming randomness, positive and negative correlation should be equally likely. So all three being positive is suspicious. I don't think records against ths spread are totally random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say we track which teams had winning records against the spread over the 1st half of the season, then bet on those teams for the 2nd half of the season. (I didn't bother to filter out the games where teams with winning records play each other, so this analysis isn't perfect.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024-25, that would give a record of 297-297 ATS -- can't get more fair than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022-23, it would have gone 279-241, for a profit of 13.9 units at standard vig, and a 53.7% winning percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021-22, it would have gone 247-225, for a loss of .5 units and a 52.3% winning percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it's definitely not enough to be profitable as a strategy on its own. But it's close, and that's interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gambler needs to win at least 52.4% of the time to break even against the vig. Say they're picking from a subset of bets that have a 52.3% chance of winning, as the naive strategy achieved in 2021-22. They'd just barely need to do better than flipping a coin to be profitable. That could be much easier than picking from a set of bets with a 50% chance of winning, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all three seasons, the public did a little worse in the first half of the season than the second half. In the two most recent seasons, the cumulative winning percentage was below 50% for nearly the whole season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't seem random to me. It makes sense that sportsbooks would offer slightly more favorable odds to the less popular team in order to attract equal money on both sides. It also makes sense that sportsbooks would be happy if the team with more money on it lost over 50% of the time. The difference between the public winning 50% of the time and the public winning 48.5% of the time could be significant on enough betting volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all three seasons, there was a positive correlation between a team's record against the spread over the first half of the season and the second half. The correlation is strong enough that over 3 seasons, it's almost possible to make money by betting on teams with a good first half record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On both points, I don't have nearly enough data to draw grand conclusions about how "the market" operates -- this is just one sportsbook, and an unknown one at that. Yahoo and DraftKings also provide betting percentage data, which would be useful for cross-checking these trends. I'm going to hold off for now, though -- there are too many other interesting things in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="sports betting"></category><category term="basketball"></category><category term="your parlay sucks"></category></entry><entry><title>The public wants what the public gets</title><link href="/the-public-wants-what-the-public-gets.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-07-18T10:20:00-10:00</published><updated>2025-07-18T10:20:00-10:00</updated><author><name>casey durfee</name></author><id>tag:None,2025-07-18:/the-public-wants-what-the-public-gets.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;code available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/book"&gt;https://github.com/csdurfee/book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Two types of people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of sportsbooks publish info on how much &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt; they've gotten on each side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's DraftKings':  &lt;a href="https://dknetwork.draftkings.com/draftkings-sportsbook-betting-splits/"&gt;https://dknetwork.draftkings.com/draftkings-sportsbook-betting-splits/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a smart move. It's good for SEO (to the extent that still matters). And I'm sure …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;code available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/book"&gt;https://github.com/csdurfee/book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE1ct5yEuVY" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Jam, &amp;quot;Going Underground&amp;quot;" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/AE1ct5yEuVY/0.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Two types of people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of sportsbooks publish info on how much &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt; they've gotten on each side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's DraftKings':  &lt;a href="https://dknetwork.draftkings.com/draftkings-sportsbook-betting-splits/"&gt;https://dknetwork.draftkings.com/draftkings-sportsbook-betting-splits/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a smart move. It's good for SEO (to the extent that still matters). And I'm sure they get a lot of people who decide to take bets from that page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the Pacers were playing Brooklyn the night I wrote this. 27% of the bets were on Brooklyn at +10.5. 73% are on Pacers -10.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody who sees that and decides to make a bet based on that information could bet either way. They could either tell themselves, "Everybody's taking the Pacers, so it must be a good bet" or "Everybody's taking the Pacers, so it must be a bad bet". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are those two groups like when they're not betting on basketball, do you think? Do they use the same kind of toothpaste? Watch the same kind of TV shows? Vote the same way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The public gets what the public wants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One bit of gambling lore is that there are "public" teams that get bet on more frequently, regardless of the line. Like, your cousin who's a Cowboys fan is going to bet the Cowboys on Thanksgiving regardless of whether it's a fair line or not.  He'd watch the game and root for the Cowboys anyway, but it's a little more fun that way. The Cowboys aren't just a random number generator to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a social aspect to gambling now that I imagine didn't exist when it was underground. Lots of gamblers will &lt;em&gt;follow&lt;/em&gt; bets that other people have placed. If the bet wins, I'm sure it's a cool communal thing to be a part of. But social media often doesn't obey the &lt;em&gt;wisdom of crowds&lt;/em&gt; -- in places like reddit where users vote content up and down, the conventional wisdom is going to be amplified, and people with minority opinions are going to be suppressed. If well over 90% of sports gamblers lose money long term, the majority opinions are going to be bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I scraped betting percentage data from &lt;a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nba-basketball/"&gt;sportsbookreview&lt;/a&gt; (SBR) for the 2024-5 season. They don't say where they get the betting percentages from. If I had to guess, it would be MGM Grand, their primary source of other data. The SBR numbers seemed to indicate more &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt; overall than a couple other sources I found -- the betting percentages were closer together. Other sites had games where there's 10% action on one side and 90% on the other, which seems implausible on a large volume of bets. So it's probably a pretty big site, whatever it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the data from the previous installment, there are 32 games out of 1230 missing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;money_percents&lt;/code&gt; column is the median amount bet on each team. The &lt;code&gt;money_game_winners&lt;/code&gt; column tracks the number of games where that team got the majority of the money bet on their side. Both of these can be taken as indicators of how much teams are favored by the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the teams sorted by money_percents. The teams near the top were less popular with gamblers, the teams at the bottom more popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The public favorites&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most popular teams with NBA gamblers were Denver, Cleveland, Memphis, Milwaukee, and Oklahoma City. Denver got the most money in 63 of 82 games they played, which is remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleveland, OKC and Memphis were dominant for most of the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denver and Milwaukee have two of the best and most entertaining players in the league. Both Giannis for Milwaukee and Jokic for Denver are fun to root for. People like to take bets on teams that are fun to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The ugly dogs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom teams were New Orleans, Charlotte, Miami, Philadelphia and Portland. All these teams except for Portland were total bummers to watch and cheer for this year. They had injuries and organizational dysfunction that led to totally wasted seasons. People don't like to take bets on teams that are a bummer to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hints at the fact that a lot of people are taking bets because they want that team to win the bet, rather than because they believe the bet has a positive expected value. It's entertainment, not a business investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Against the spread&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia, Washington and Phoenix were just as terrible at the sportsbook as they were on the basketball court. OKC and Cleveland had outstanding seasons in both places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there's only a rough correlation between how good the teams were at actual basketball, and at beating the spread. Minnesota, New York and Denver were in the bottom 10 by winning % against the spread, even though they had good records and were doing their best to win. Denver lost to the eventual champs, and New York and Minnesota made the conference finals. Indiana was the 10th worst team against the spread, and made the NBA Finals. Toronto and Brooklyn weren't really trying to win a lot of basketball games, but ended up in the top 10. There is no good reason I can think of for the Lakers to be in the top 4 against the spread -- aren't they the epitome of a public team that should be getting unfavorable lines? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Which teams should the public love and hate?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I calculated the amount of units a gambler would win or lose if they bet on each team when they got the majority of the bets.  This is a sort of measure how happy the proverbial public should be about each team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;public_units&lt;/code&gt; is the amount won/lost betting in favor of the team. Phoenix, Sacramento, Dallas, Denver and Indiana disappointed the public the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty random list of teams, in both directions. It's a good illustration that gamblingball is different from basketball. It's not clear whether gamblingball is a game with an element of skill, or if it's all chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Are records against the spread due to chance?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we assume that all variations are due to randomess, each game should be a coin flip whether the underdog or favorite wins against the spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculating exact odds using the binomial distribution, 94% of NBA teams should have between 33 and 49 wins against the spread over an 82 game season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd expect 2 teams to be outside that range, and there are 3. Philadelphia went 26-52 in 78 games we have data for. Even if they won the other 4 games that are missing data, they'd only have 30 wins. So that record was definitely an outlier, but overall the season was about what we'd expect based on chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it very believable that some teams are more likely to have a winning record against the spread, because they are underestimated by the handicappers or the betting public. They end up getting lines that are too generous, and thus do better than expected against the spread over the long run. Toronto could be an example of that. They were bad, but they weren't really as bad as people thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other teams could be inherently worse against the spread, as well. Perhaps they are super popular to bet on, so the lines tend to move against them -- a &lt;em&gt;public team&lt;/em&gt;. Or perhaps gamblers and sportsbooks overvalue the team -- the conventional wisdom is that they'll be good when they're not. That definitely describes Philadelphia and Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, &lt;em&gt;the teams themselves&lt;/em&gt; aren't necessarily doing anything to be better or worse against the spread than an average team would be. It's about the perceptions of the bookmakers and gamblers. Teams can't help what bookmakers set the lines to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do gamblers follow the record against the spread?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a team's record against the spread is due solely to random error, then we've got a &lt;a href="/LeSimulation.html"&gt;LeMartingale&lt;/a&gt; on our hands. The current record would have no bearing on the future record. So gamblers shouldn't factor it in when deciding to take a bet or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the season, there was a significant correlation between money percents and win percentage against the spread. I wanted to see how that might've changed over time. So I generated the table shown above for every single day of the season, and calculated the correlation on that day.  Here's what that looks like over time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/money-ats-win-pct.png" src="/img/money-ats-win-pct.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money percentages are cumulative, the mean of all games in the season that have come before -- it's not showing gamblers' betting behavior on a particular day. The graph is a lot smoother that way, but we're losing something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also doesn't show whether records against the spread are a Martingale or not. The correlation between betting percentages and win records increases over time, but that doesn't mean this is because gamblers are behaving &lt;em&gt;rationally&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jump in correlation around mid-Februrary corresponds to the All-Star break, which is curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Efficiency of betting markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficient market hypothesis says that given enough time and competition, free markets are able to establish the correct price for a commodity. In the case of sports betting, we could think of it as the price of a money line bet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a money line bet, you are betting on who will win the game straight up. You get a smaller payout for betting on the favorite, and a larger payout betting on the underdog. In the United States, money line bets are written in a goofy way. If the money line is negative, that's how much money you have to risk in order to win $100. For example, -200 indicates you have to risk $200 to win $100. If it is positive, that's how much money you win if you risk $100. If it sounds like a bad way to write the odds, you're correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A market maker will respond to an imbalance in bets by adjusting the price. If CLE -300 is a good value, people will rationally want to take it, driving the price up to, say -400. If it is a bad value, people will rationally want to take the other side and the price might go down to -200. These rational actors will collectively push the price towards the best possible estimate that humans can make given all information available at the time. It serves as a sort of collective intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first installment, I showed that humans are irrational when it comes to sports betting, so I was skeptical of how good, or fair, the lines could be. Could I find proof of this collective intelligence in action? Are there any obvious market inefficiencies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The data &amp;amp; stuff to know&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stats are from the NBA season. I screen-scraped the data from &lt;a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nba-basketball/"&gt;sportsbookreview.com&lt;/a&gt;. All data is from the MGM Grand. Unfortunately, some data is missing around Christmas, and a few random days in between. 32 games are missing from the data set out of 1230 total, 2.6% of all games. These are games that don't appear on sportsbookreview's website, or have incomplete data on there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an analysis of the MGM Grand's NBA lines for 2025. It's not a comprehensive guide to how the lines work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are always two lines on each game, one for the home team and one for the away team. Each side may have different vigs. Say for instance Bucks @ Pacers starts out at IND +3.5 -110/MIL -3.5 -110. It could close at IND +3.5 -115/MIL -3.5 -105. So it costs more to bet on the Pacers, but the actual line didn't move.  I'm mostly ignoring that, but will point out when it's relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Line" and "spread" mean the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Reduced juice" means risking -105 or -106 instead of the usual -110 to win 100. A "unit" is a gambler's standard betting size. "4.1 units of profit" would mean +$410 for a gambler betting $100 a game. Both are explained in much more detail in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A note about pushes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the final score agrees with the line exactly, neither side of the bet can be declared a winner. This is called a push. The bet is cancelled and everybody gets their money back. The casino makes nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MGM Grand always keeps point spreads on the half point (eg +6.5 or +7.5 rather than +7) so that they will never push. I don't think it's a bad policy, and I'm surprised more sportsbooks don't do it. The sportsbooks know how good their customers are at betting, so they should probably shade the point spread a half a point towards the side of the bet that has the less savvy bettors on it. (This assumes the sportsbook can identify and ban arbitrage gamblers, but more about that in the book.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a wisdom of crowds, the final lines should be more accurate than the opening lines. Are they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My code calculates the difference between the final score and the line, called the error.  Because the MGM's lines always end in a half point, that means the error is going to be artificially high -- there will never be a game where it is exactly zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening and closing lines are a set of predictions. The smaller the difference between the line and reality, the better the prediction. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error"&gt;Mean Squared Error&lt;/a&gt; is a standard way to compare two prediction systems in statistics and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSE for the opening lines is 191.06, and the closing lines is 184.8. So we can say that in aggregate, the closing lines are more accurate than the opening lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSE can't tell us how good the closing lines are, though, just that one set of predictions is better than another set. It's a relative measure, not an absolute one. We're squaring the error, so the MSE will always be positive. The errors in one direction don't cancel out ones in the other direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at how far the lines were off by. the Os are the opening lines, and X's are the closing lines. If the &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is closer to the center line than the &lt;em&gt;O&lt;/em&gt;, the market action made the line more accurate. I've plotted a random sample of 300 games to make the plot more readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/scatter-mess.png" src="/img/scatter-mess.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that doesn't really show us much about how or when the closing lines are better than the opening ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adam Smith, Handicapper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When were the closing lines more accurate than the opening lines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closing lines were better in 467 games, versus 384 games where the opening lines were better, and 347 games where the line never changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the free market were a handicapper, and we interpreted the line movements as a bet on one side, they would have a 54.88% winning percentage (and 347 pushes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that's a respectable win percentage for a human trying to beat the spread, I was expecting better from the free market. The market only being right 55% of the time holds true for a couple of previous seasons I have looked at as well. NBA betting, as a market, is not very efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are good reasons for that. Sportsbooks that set the opening lines aren't trying that hard to be accurate. It's just a first guess. Only a tiny percentage of money is wagered at the opening line number. However, there are good reasons why lines tend not to move very much, even when the opening line is a bad one. For an in-depth explanation, check out &lt;em&gt;The Logic of Sports Betting&lt;/em&gt;, by Miller and Davidow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The myth of closing line value&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pinnacle.com/betting-resources/en/betting-strategy/using-the-closing-line-to-test-your-skill-in-betting/7e6jwjm5ykejuwkq"&gt;The conventional wisdom&lt;/a&gt; is that sports betting markets are efficient, so that the only way to make money over the long run is by doing better than the closing lines, picking up on any flaws in the opening lines before the market eliminates them. Anyone else can only make a profit due to chance. From this perspective, the right way to measure a handicapper's skill is how their picks compare to the closing line. Say the opening line is Nuggets -3, and I take the bet at that number. The closing line is Nuggets -6. Then I captured 3 points of value against the closing line. This is known as closing line value (CLV). (We can figure out how valuable those 3 points are, and I show how in the book.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beating the closing line might be positively correlated with higher profits when analyzing betting records of touts -- people who sell betting picks for money. But when the market is wrong 45% of the time, focusing too much on CLV seems like a bad idea. There's no good reason to believe that a gambler is destined to lose money by picking against the closing lines. What if their strategy is to mostly bet against the prevailing wisdom on the 45% of games where the market is wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLV is a prime example of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law"&gt;Goodhart's Law&lt;/a&gt;. As a measure of a handicapper's skill, it's probably fine (though not ideal). But it shouldn't be the target. A gambler shouldn't make picks explicitly to capture as much CLV as possible. That could be different on other sports. Football -- both forms of it -- attracts a lot more betting than the NBA does, so if you're looking for the wisdom of crowds, maybe look there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say the opening line is Nuggets -3 against the Timberwolves. I like the Nuggets in this matchup, but I think the public will go for the Timberwolves and it will finish at Nuggets -1/Timberwolves +1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I was trying to capture as much CLV as possible on this bet, I should take the Timberwolves +3 on the opening line, even though that's not the side I actually like! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I was trying to actually win the bet, I should take the Nuggets at the closing line, hoping maybe I can get Nuggets -1 or even Nuggets +1. I can never get positive CLV on the Nuggets, because the market was wrong about them. Not me, the market!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLV gets described as being the best way to test a handicapper's skill, but it's obviously non-optimal. Maybe it's the contrarian in me, but Opening Line Value -- identifying bets where the market is going to be wrong, and waiting till the last minute to place the bet -- is more impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to test a handicapper is to have them write out what they think the lines should be, rather than making a binary decision about somebody else's line (favorite or underdog). If a handicapper's lines are closer to the truth than the closing lines, they are good at handicapping. Looking at what bets they took is only a secondary signal of that. If they took Nuggets -7, is it because they thought the true line should be Nuggets -8, or Nuggets -12? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When the line doesn't move&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting aside why the market moves in the wrong direction 45% of the time, I'm curious about the games where the spread didn't move at all. Maybe those lines were perfect as-is? If so, we'd expect to see equal splits of home vs. away winners, and underdog vs. favorite winners.  There shouldn't be any bias to those games. The free market is essentially labelling these the pinnacle of the handicapper's art, impossible to be improved upon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the predicted outcome (the line) and the actual outcome is a combination of how much the line maker got it wrong, plus random variation. So the games where the line didn't move should be totally random, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're not. If we look at games where the line didn't move, the away team went 184-163 in those games. Someone betting the away team in every game where the line didn't move would win 53% of their bets, for 4.7 units of profit at full vig, or 11.2 units of profit at &lt;em&gt;reduced juice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also a bias towards underdogs, who went 186-161 in this situation. Always taking the underdog would give a 53.6% winning percentage, for 8.9 units at full vig, or 15.3 units at reduced juice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an even bigger bias if we combine the two. Away underdogs went 122-92 in these games, which is a 55.2% winning percentage, for 13.1 units of profit at full vig, and 17.1 at reduced juice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these results are statistically significant, but they are very :thinking_face_emoji:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;About the vig&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the vig is imbalanced, the side with the higher vig should be more likely to win, because they're winning less money in return. Moving the vig from -110 to -115 is a way for the bookmaker to discourage bets on one side without moving the line. Likewise moving it to -105 is a way to encourage bets on that side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the MGM Grand always keeps their lines on the half point, we'd expect them to adjust the vig often rather than change the spread. They do for most of the games where they didn't move the lines, but 39% of the time the vig stays at -110.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we break down the games where the line didn't move by vig, the underdogs went 62-43 when the vig was high (-115), 74-62 when the vig was at the standard level (-110), and 50-56 at low vig (-105).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone taking the underdogs when the line doesn't move, and the vig is -110 or -115, would've gone 136-105 this season, a 56.4% winning percentage, and around 18 units of profit (factoring in the additional -115 vig on some bets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the strategy is pretty convoluted, and I wouldn't bet on it holding for future seasons, but it's definitely evidence there could be irrational factors at work in the market. It certainly doesn't show the market to be the well oiled machine that Closing Line Value assumes it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Must love dogs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winners ended up being pretty evenly divided between favorites and underdogs by the end of the season, but underdogs were way ahead for most of the year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betting every single underdog against the spread over the first quarter of the season would've been fairly profitable -- a 165-136 record (54.8% winning percentage), and 15.4 units profit at full vig. People betting favorites got killed at the beginning of the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs and favorites were basically even through the middle half of the season, before favorites finished off 167-144 (53.7% win percentage) to even things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a plot of the winning percentage of favorites over the course of the season. I skipped the first 50 games because of noise. The yellow line represents the winning percentage necessary for betting all underdogs to be profitable (at standard vig). That happens when the favorites win less than 47.6% of the time (which means underdogs win more than 52.4% of the time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't until the last month of the season that blindly betting all underdogs started being a losing proposition, even factoring in the vig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/wp-vs-gameno.png" src="/img/wp-vs-gameno.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Did the lines improve over time?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was curious if there was evidence that the errors were getting smaller, or more predictable over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raw errors are too noisy to see any sort of pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/err-vs-line.png" src="/img/err-vs-line.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a plot of the 100 game moving average of the absolute error of the closing line. I don't see any trends to suggest the lines got more accurate with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/closing-line-err.png" src="/img/closing-line-err.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of the error against the closing line isn't the ideal metric, because not all points are created equal -- the higher the line, the less surprising the error. (I'm going to skip discussing that for now, but it's explained in the book.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Did the lines change over time?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered whether the size of the lines changed over time -- did the games get more or less competitive over the course of the season?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a 100 game moving average of the average size of the spread. As we can see, the lines did get bigger near the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/spread-over-time.png" src="/img/spread-over-time.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible the trend is due to scheduling, but the change at the end seems significant -- teams tend to give up near the end of the year. Bad teams want to be as bad as possible in order to get the best odds in the NBA draft, so they're not that competitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I have a lot more to say about tanking, but I'll stay off my soapbox for now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What type of games are affected by line movement?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 130 games where the winner flipped from the favorite to the underdog, or the underdog to the favorite, because of the line movement. In other words, these are games where either side could have won the bet, depending on whether you took the opening line or the closing line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These games were perfectly balanced -- 65 times, the favorite won (vs the closing line); 65 times the underdog won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about games where the spread was extremely accurate (off by 3 points or less)? Underdogs went 138-121 in those games (53.2%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference is more dramatic in games where the line was off by 1 point or less. The underdogs went 56-33 (63% win percentage). Of course, there's no way to use that as a betting strategy since we can't identify these games before the fact, but it does show a small potential bias in favor of underdogs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What would "perfect" lines even look like?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's rare to see NBA lines that are bigger than +15/-15 points. There were 15 this season, about 4.4% of all games. That's around one NBA game a week with a line that high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, 31% of NBA games end with a score differential of over 15 points. That's 7x more often, roughly one game a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lines really shouldn't be as large as the final score differential, because they are an estimate of the mean outcome of the game. If the Celtics beat the Raptors by 54 points, that doesn't mean the line &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have been Celtics -54. The Celtics and Raptors played 4 times last season (data taken from &lt;a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/TOR/2025_games.html"&gt;basketball-reference&lt;/a&gt;). I'm going to ignore home court advantage -- imagine these are played at a neutral gym. The first game, Boston won by 3. The second, Boston won by 54. The third game, the Raptors won by 13. The last game, Boston won by 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston won by an average of 13.5 points, so BOS -13.5 would be a reasonable line for all four games, as that's the best estimate we can make of their difference in skill. Only 1 of the 4 games ended up close to that line. For the other 3 games, the error was at least 10 points. That's pretty typical for NBA games. The error is usually around 10 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, Boston -- despite being the much better team -- would have gone 1-3 against the spread. If the line for all four games was BOS -9.5, they would have gone 2-2, but the error would still be 44.5 points on the second game, and 23.5 on the third one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual outcomes might be all over the place, but the spread isn't meant to predict the actual outcome, just the point where both sides are equally likely to win the bet. In a small sample size, there's no guarantee both sides will win 50% of the games, even if the line was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a histogram of the spreads (for the away team) overlaid on a histogram of the errors against the spread:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/spread-vs-score-diff.png" src="/img/spread-vs-score-diff.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at just the score differential, we can stick a bell curve over the top and it looks pretty normal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/score-diff-normal.png" src="/img/score-diff-normal.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Simulating games from the spreads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, these aren't outcomes from one distribution. Every game is essentially a sample from a different distribution. Each game has a different mean (the spread, or rather the ideal version of it) and a different variance (how predictable games are between the two teams). Combining them all together, the results end up looking kinda normal (because a lot of things do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to simulate the entire season to show how the point differentials are going to be much bigger than the original lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I simulated every game by sampling from a normal distribution with the mean set to that game's spread, and the variance equal to the sample variance of all games that season with that spread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how they match up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/point-differential.png" src="/img/point-differential.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that's a pretty rough simulation. There's some weirdness in the middle. NBA games never end in a tie, and they end in a one point difference less often than expected due to tactical reasons, so there's a little notch right in the center of the green curve. If a team is down one, they foul the other team and hope they miss at least one of their free throws. There's also more simulated games than I would expect that end with a differential of +1 or -1. There very well may be a bug in my code. So there's a muddle in the middle. But the spread of the data is the same, which is the main point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the simulation shows that the lines shouldn't be bigger than they are, even though they are frequently off by many multiples compared to the final result. An error of 10 is about what we'd expect on average, and big errors don't necessarily mean &lt;em&gt;Vegas&lt;/em&gt; was wrong. If the line is Dallas -3 and the other team wins by 27, that doesn't mean the line was off by 30 points. The line is meant to be an estimate of the mean outcome, if the teams played each other a large number of time under the exact same conditions. We only ever see one sample, though, and a lot of times it is far from the mean.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="sports betting"></category><category term="basketball"></category><category term="your parlay sucks"></category></entry><entry><title>Cool Parlay, Bro</title><link href="/cool-parlay-bro.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-07-16T10:20:00-10:00</published><updated>2025-07-16T10:20:00-10:00</updated><author><name>casey durfee</name></author><id>tag:None,2025-07-16:/cool-parlay-bro.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Code at &lt;a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/book"&gt;https://github.com/csdurfee/book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sportsbooks have many ways of encouraging people to lose their money as quickly and efficiently as possible. One of the best ways to do this is a type of bet called the parlay. "Parlez" means "to talk" in French, so it's no surprise …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Code at &lt;a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/book"&gt;https://github.com/csdurfee/book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sportsbooks have many ways of encouraging people to lose their money as quickly and efficiently as possible. One of the best ways to do this is a type of bet called the parlay. "Parlez" means "to talk" in French, so it's no surprise dudes always want to talk about them online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind a parlay is that you can bet on multiple events at once and if they all win, you make a nice profit, otherwise you lose. On a technical level, if the first bet on the parlay wins, the winnings are immediately placed on the second bet in the parlay, if that wins, it rolls over to the third bet, and so on. It's a sequence of bets, with the stakes going up with each bet. The individual bets in the parlay are known as "legs".   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to keep asking this question: why would they be offering this bet if it was good for you?  Parlays might be more fun, but that just means they found a way to get you to part with your money easier, which sounds like a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can compare different bets by using Expected Value (EV). EV is the weighted average of all the possible outcomes. If the expected value is positive, we will make money over the long run; if it's negative, we will lose money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vegasinsider.com/parlay-calculator/"&gt;The traditional payout on a 4 team parlay is 10:1&lt;/a&gt;. What is the expected value of such a play? is it higher or lower than taking the individual bets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to grind the math on this one, and see which option is better. I can't say "make us more money" because both types of bets are guaranteed losers without some sort of edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parlays are such a bad type of bet on the surface that to understand them, I have to give a little taste of parlay culture first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nephew Doug&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you want to place some bets. You just learned about betting on sports, so as a newbie you're trying to learn from experts by listening to gambling podcasts. These guys have been gambling for decades. Surely they must know what's up. Their wisdom will give you the edge for sure. Surely they will keep you from making costly mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've listened to Nephew Doug's podcast, and wrote down his Locks of the Week. You're ready to enter them into your betting app, which has been hand-optimized to be as much of a dopamine and money sink as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you listen every week, you know Nephew Doug has been burdened by the Gods with the gift of prophecy. Just ask him. He's like a modern day Cassandra, only it's about how the Cowboys are always going to suck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the Gods like a little competition. The Olympics were invented as a religious ceremony in their honor, after all. But they're not above making a call from on high to nudge the result a little bit. Yes, Zeus is definitely a Chiefs fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you believe ahead of time Nephew Doug's picks will win 55% of the time. Which way of betting these picks will bring you the most money in the long run?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) "throw 'em all in a 4 team parlay" like Doug and his buddy Jorts Guy do  &lt;br&gt;
2) randomly choose 3 of Nephew Doug's picks and bet them individually. Don't do anything with the 4th one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe option 2 seems insane to you. But let's game it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You listen to Nephew Doug, but I don't. My assumption would be this guy is no better than a coin flip -- he only wins 50% of the time, or close to it. Parlays at old school casinos pay at 10:1 and online sportsbooks pay 12.28:1. Let's see how that works out at 10:1 payout, the ones Jorts Guy and Nephew Doug were cutting their teeth on back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to do the comparison. We could bet $100 on the parlay, and compare to putting $25 on each leg. Or we could compare $100 on the parlay to $100 on each leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither way of comparing is entirely fair, though, because the stakes increase throughout each leg of the parlay. If a gambler bets $100 on a 4 team parlay, they're risking $100 on the first leg. Assuming they keep winning, they're risking $190 on the 2nd leg, $300ish dollars on the 3rd leg, and $600ish dollars on the 4th leg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each leg of the parlay, the gambler should consider the risk of losing out on $600 if they took a 3 team parlay and it won. Risking $100 on the 4 leg parlay is sort of like taking 4 different $600 bets, because each one could cost the gambler that much if it loses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be comparing risking $100 on the parlay versus $25 on each of the legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7x worse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This difference only matters for bettors with a high degree of skill. For the beginner, who we can reasonably assume will no better than a coin flip, the parlay is always a worse option. Almost 7 times worse. The parlays lose about 30% per bet, versus 4.5% for the straight bets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yikes. Maybe parlays are fun, but it's like blowing the whole week's vig budget on Sunday when compared to taking one regular bet a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a stretch of good luck is going to get swallowed up real fast if you're losing 30% of the stake on average. These types of parlays are a sadness machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Partially blessed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if Nephew Doug truly has been partially blessed by the Gods, and can beat the lines 55% of the time? That's pretty good. Only a small percentage of sports bettors can achieve that, in my research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gambler should turn a profit either way, but maybe parlays offer a better return? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parlays have an expected return of +0.66%, versus +5% for the straight bets. The straight bets make 7.6x as much money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, what about if we just don't play the 4th bet? We will bet on the first three legs, and don't play the 4th one. We put the $25 for the fourth bet in our piggy bank and earn a 0% interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're throwing out a bet with positive expected value, and risking angering the Gods by ignoring their chosen sports prophet, Nephew Doug. Perhaps that will tilt things in the parlay's favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope! The straight bets have a return of +3.75%, which is still 5.7x better than the parlays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let's say we flip a coin to decide the 4th bet. It will only win 50% of the time, which means it's a guaranteed loser because of the vig -- you win less than you have to risk. (There is much more about the vig in the book.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope! The coin flip hurts our profitability, but we're still clearing +2.6%, which is 4x better than the parlays. We'd have to do 2 of 4 bets by coin flip for the parlays to be more profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, 55% is just &lt;em&gt;barely&lt;/em&gt; profitable for an old-school parlay. The profitability increases exponentially as the win rate goes up. There is a win rate where parlays would make more money than the straight bets. If you win 100% of the time, the parlay is definitely a better deal, right? 10x profits taking the parlay versus 4x taking the original bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful handicappers who sell their picks on the internet are only winning around 55% of the time. If you have to do as well at something as people who do it for a living just to break even, that's not a great plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Online Parlays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online 4 leg parlays pay out $1228 per $100 risked, which make them a little less bad. However, they're still way worse for the average gambler than taking the straight bets. At a 50% win rate, online parlays have an expected return of -17%, versus -4.5% for the straight bets. So they're 3.7x worse. They're half as bad as the old school parlays, but still terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That $1228.33 payout for online parlays was chosen deliberately. It means that online parlays have the same break-even point as the individual bets (at standard vig) -- winning 52.4% of the individual bets. Because parlay profits climb exponentially, that means a skilled bettor with a 55% win rate will have a much higher EV with the parlays. They will have a +21.6% rate of return, versus +5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;EV doesn't describe the range of outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expected Value is a good way of determining whether you can make money taking a certain type of bet, but it doesn't describe the range of possible outcomes.  With parlays, a lot of those outcomes are bad, even for a gambler with enough skill to make them more profitable on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simulations are great in this sort of situation, because they can convey the range of possible outcomes in a way EV can't.  I simulated 200 individual bets versus 50 parlays, and ran that 10,000 times. Our virtual gambler wins 55% of the time, and bets $100 on parlays, $25 on each individual bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual bets made more money (or lost less money) than the parlays 38% of the time. Just because the expected value is higher for the parlays, that doesn't mean they will always be more profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More concerningly, the parlays had big losses (down more than $1000 on $100 bets) 33% of the time. That only happened 0.2% of the time on the straight bets. There were almost no small losses with the parlays, because the payout is so high and the number of bets (50 parlays) is so low. Winning one more parlay could be the difference between being down $1000, and breaking even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expected Value can't be the only thing we consider, because we don't live an infinite life. Our whole life is a small sample size, if the variance is high enough. Our bankrolls are always finite. The fact that we might make more money over 100 years is undercut by the fact that we'll die or go broke before then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even for the skilled bettor, parlays make it more of a game of luck. Let's say my simulation represents an entire season of betting on basketball. Imagine playing the parlays with a 55% win rate, being better than almost everybody at handicapping, and still having massive losses one season in three? When you'd make more money taking the individual bets 40% of the time, and only have a 1 in 500 chance of bad losses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Parlay psychology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a weird psychology to the parlay as well. Even if you played every day, these parlays only win once every couple of weeks, so they'd be kind of a grim strategy in practice. A good bettor taking the individual bets will have winning days over half the time. Is it better to feel like a winner most days, or every other week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people don't have to consider that question, though. Without a huge amount of skill at betting, the only scenario where they might make sense is as a lottery: something that can deliver a tiny chance of massive payouts without any skill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if we do the same simulation, but the win rate is 50%, like a coin flip, or most sports bettors? The parlays make money 38% of the time! Taking 200 straight bets will only make money 26% of the time. Isn't that a little surprising?  Even though the straight bets have better expected value (well, less bad), they also offer less of an opportunity to make money based on chance alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about over a longer time frame? I simulated 500 parlays versus 2,000 straight bets by flipping a coin. The parlays make money 12% of the time, versus only 1.74% of the time for the straight bets. However, the losses are much, much bigger than the wins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="/img/parlay-500.png" src="/img/parlay-500.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12% is 1 in 8, which isn't that rare. 500 parlays could end up stretching over multiple seasons, perhaps a lifetime of sports betting. That means somebody who was making picks by flipping a coin could end up looking like a pretty good bettor for a long stretch if they are taking parlays. Of course, 88% of people will lose money, far more money than the 12% of profitable bettors win. In practical terms, it's like a lottery where you have a 12% chance of winning $3617, but an 88% chance of losing $10,221. Sound like fun?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really, really hard to tell if someone taking bets at long odds is actually good at betting, not without thousands of documented bets. Over 50 parlays, or even 500, it's not that surprising for some people to look smart on parlays by chance alone. It would be much better to assess their skill based on the individual bets they took within the parlays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other parlays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parlays with only 2 or 3 legs have higher relative payouts compared to 4 leg parlays, so they're not nearly as bad. They'll also have less variance in outcomes than the 4+ leggers. I'll leave those calculations to the reader, though. While they're one of the least bad bets offered by the average sportsbook, it's extremely rare to see people talking about 2 or 3 leg parlays online. Gamblers love the higher payouts and drama of parlays with a bunch of legs. I will have a lot more to say about how people actually play the parlays in a future installment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same Game Parlays (SGPs) are a new type of bet which allows the player to make multiple wagers on the same game. For instance, someone could bet on their favorite team winning and their favorite player scoring over a certain amount of points and the guy they hate on the other team scoring under a certain amount of points, with a big payout if all 3 things happen. SGPs have become the most popular type of bet I see online, and deserve their own lengthy discussion. For now just think of them as the vape pens of betting. They're obviously super addictive, extremely popular with younger people, and you can't really know what's in them, but it's probably bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gambling gurus, and the people who listen to them&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've taken up lot of hobbies over the years. It seems like every time I take up a new hobby, I end up spending a lot of money on stupid stuff at the beginning. Then I get into it more, and realize what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an adverse selection process, where people who are new to a hobby have no idea what's actually good, what they actually need, or what things should actually cost. Filled with zeal to get started, they end up overpaying for inferior goods. Same thing for travelling in a new country. The guys at the train station trying to hustle you into a taxi are definitely not hooking you up with the cheapest way to get around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betting experts, the kind who have podcasts and big followings on social media, are supposed to know more about this stuff than the average person. They're supposed to be like the guidebooks, or the seasoned traveller telling the newbie to walk 2 blocks and take the metro for $2 instead of paying $100 for a taxi. Yet they're pushing parlays and other sucker bets, and pushing sportsbooks that charge full vig and ban anybody who wins too much. The "experts" are pushing beginners into bad situations. They're the creeps at the train station hustling naive tourists into their buddy's taxi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these experts don't do any better than flipping a coin, so I doubt they're actually making money on their "can't miss locks of the week". Gambling ads, sure. Everybody's taking gambling money right now, regardless of how it will hurt their brand, their audience, and sports long term. Clearly there's a lot of money in talking about it. That gambling money is there because these self-styled experts bring the sportsbooks more customers -- losing customers, specifically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where's all that ad money coming from? The sportsbooks wouldn't be throwing money at influencers who were actually winning consistently. Any gambling show they sponsor is pretty much guaranteed to lose you money, or it wouldn't be sponsored. Any bet they're promoting heavily, like they do with parlays, is because it makes them more money that way. You shouldn't need to know any math to figure out why they're pushing teasers and parlays and "profit boosters". I love that last one. It's like saying Idi Amin served mankind. Why would they care about boosting YOUR profits? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike gamblers, sportsbooks don't make negative expected value plays due to emotions or lack of information. Your irrationality is their entire business.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="sports betting"></category><category term="basketball"></category><category term="your parlay sucks"></category></entry><entry><title>Sports betting and the limits of rationality</title><link href="/sports-betting-and-the-limits-of-rationality.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-07-12T10:20:00-10:00</published><updated>2025-07-12T10:20:00-10:00</updated><author><name>casey durfee</name></author><id>tag:None,2025-07-12:/sports-betting-and-the-limits-of-rationality.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I wrote most of a book about the psychology and mathematics of sports gambling called &lt;em&gt;Your Parlay Sucks&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Why …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I wrote most of a book about the psychology and mathematics of sports gambling called &lt;em&gt;Your Parlay Sucks&lt;/em&gt;. The book never quite came together, and is probably too weird to ever get published, but it has some interesting bits, so I figured I'd share them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I get interested enough in sports betting to write a whole book about it? I think it's because I'm fascinated by the limits of rationality. Philosophers, economists and social scientists would like to treat humans as though they are capable of making rational decisions. That conflicts with the real world, where even pretty smart people make irrational choices. I certainly have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sports betting is a sort of rationality lab. You and I might have different values or beliefs. What's crazy to me might be normal to you, or vice versa, but we should both be able to agree that placing bets that are guaranteed to lose money is irrational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1553935"&gt;This paper&lt;/a&gt;, "Intuitive Biases in Choice versus Estimation", is a wonderful illustration of cognitive bias and irrationality in the realm of sports betting.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers had people bet on NFL football against the point spread. If you're not familiar, the idea behind the point spread is to attract an equal amount of action on both sides of the bet by handicapping one of the teams. If you bet on the favorite, they need to win by at least the amount of the spread for the bet to win. The other side side wins if the team loses by less than the spread, or wins the game outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamblers can bet either side, and if there are more bets on one side than the other, the sportsbook can change the spread to attract equal action. So there's a potential for the wisdom of crowds to kick in, the invisible hand of the market moving the line towards the best estimate possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that depends on gamblers being rational. A rational gambler has to be willing to take either side of a bet (or not bet at all), depending on the spread. If the spread is biased towards the underdog, they should be willing to take the underdog. If it's biased towards the favorite, they should take the favorite. And if the line is perfectly fair, they shouldn't bet at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I showed a while back with &lt;a href="/majority-voting-in-ensemble-learning.html"&gt;ensemble learning&lt;/a&gt;, the wisdom of crowds only works if the errors that people make are uncorrelated with each other. If most people are wrong about a particular thing, the "wisdom of crowds" will be wrong, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study found that people are consistently irrational when it comes to point spreads. They will tend to bet the favorite, even though both sides should have an equal chance of winning. It's probably easier to focus on which team is better, and assume that the better team is more likely to win against the point spread as well. It's harder to imagine the underdog losing the game but winning the bet, or pulling an upset and winning outright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study took things further and adjusted the lines to be biased against the favorite team, so that taking the favorite would be guaranteed to lose more than 50% of the time. They even told the gamblers that they did this. And the gamblers still overwhelmingly picked the favorites. The researchers continued the study for the whole season. Even after weeks and weeks of steadily losing, being told over and over that the lines are unfair, the gamblers still preferred to take the favorites. They never learned. The participants got to keep their winnings, so they had an incentive to be right. And they still couldn't do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sportsbooks have a lot of ways of trick people into taking extra bad bets, as I will show. But they don't really need to. People will consistently take bad bets even if they should know they're bad bets. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="sports betting"></category><category term="football"></category><category term="your parlay sucks"></category></entry><entry><title>The final word on the hot hand (for now)</title><link href="/the-final-word-on-the-hot-hand-for-now.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-06-30T10:20:00-10:00</published><updated>2025-06-30T10:20:00-10:00</updated><author><name>casey durfee</name></author><id>tag:None,2025-06-30:/the-final-word-on-the-hot-hand-for-now.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;(Notebooks and other code available at: &lt;a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/hot_hand"&gt;https://github.com/csdurfee/hot_hand&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

However, most players don't have enough attempts when they've gone 0 or 5 out of their last 5 for a good statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead I will be looking at a binary split -- I will call a player &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt; when they've made 0, 1 or 2 of their last 5 shots, and &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt; when they've made 3, 4 or 5 of their last 5. Most players have a FG% between 40 and 60%, so this nicely splits them into times when they're shooting better than average versus worse than average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anthony Edwards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony Edwards ("Ant") is particularly unstreaky for a young player. He's only completed 5 seasons in the league, but has the 5th biggest z score of the last 20 years. He could definitely catch LeBron someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ant has the LeBron-like pattern of FG% trending downward when he's &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt;. He doesn't have anywhere near the volume of LeBron, so the spike at 20% (1/5) might just be noise. But overall, he shoots worse when he's been shooting well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ant-last-5" src="/img/ant-last-5.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend appears to be due to shot selection. He takes far more above the break 3 pointers when he's &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt; than when he's cold. The additional 3 point attempts come at the expense of shots in the restricted area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the changes in tendencies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
| BASIC_ZONE            |   hot |   cold |   diff |
|:----------------------|------:|-------:|-------:|
| Above the Break 3     |  41.5 |   31.7 |    9.8 |
| Corner 3              |   3.6 |    4.8 |   -1.2 |
| In The Paint (Non-RA) |  13.4 |   14.6 |   -1.1 |
| Mid-Range             |  14.1 |   12.2 |    1.9 |
| Restricted Area       |  27.4 |   36.7 |   -9.4 |
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this would be justified if Ant shot above the break 3's better when he's &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt;, but he doesn't. He makes 37% of his above the break 3's when he's &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt; but that drops to 34% when he's hot. So he's trading restricted area shots, with an expected value of .601 * 2 = 1.202 points, for above the break 3's, with an expected value of .34 * 3 = 1.02 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the changes in FG percentages. His FG% on corner 3's goes up, but it's on insignificant volume:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
| BASIC_ZONE            |   hot |   cold |   diff |
|:----------------------|------:|-------:|-------:|
| Above the Break 3     |  34   |   37.1 |   -3.1 |
| Corner 3              |  45   |   33   |   12   |
| In The Paint (Non-RA) |  40.8 |   34   |    6.8 |
| Mid-Range             |  36.3 |   34.8 |    1.5 |
| Restricted Area       |  60.1 |   65.4 |   -5.2 |
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The rest of the league&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at league-wide shot selection in &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt; situations. I restricted to the last 10 seasons, since the rise of the 3 pointer has dramatically changed shot selection. Here are changes in shot selection for all players:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
| BASIC_ZONE            |   hot |   cold |   diff |
|:----------------------|------:|-------:|-------:|
| Above the Break 3     |  22.1 |   22.3 |   -0.2 |
| Corner 3              |   6.2 |    7   |   -0.9 |
| In The Paint (Non-RA) |  15.8 |   15.3 |    0.4 |
| Mid-Range             |  25.3 |   23.5 |    1.8 |
| Restricted Area       |  30.7 |   31.8 |   -1.2 |
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mid-range shot is the lowest value shot type, so it's notable that the rate goes up when players are &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt;. These additional mid ranges come at the expense of Corner 3's and Restricted Area shots, the two most valuable types of shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before, changes in shot selection could be justified if players actually shoot differently based on their last 5 results, but they don't. Here are the changes in shooting percentages (hot minus cold) for all players:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
| BASIC_ZONE            |   hot |   cold |   diff |
|:----------------------|------:|-------:|-------:|
| Above the Break 3     |  34.7 |   35   |   -0.3 |
| Corner 3              |  38.4 |   38.9 |   -0.4 |
| In The Paint (Non-RA) |  41.7 |   41.2 |    0.5 |
| Mid-Range             |  39.8 |   40.1 |   -0.3 |
| Restricted Area       |  62.7 |   60.7 |    2   |
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 3 out of 5 shot types, the &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt; FG percentages are lower than the &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt; ones. Combined with the changes in shot selection, I think there's evidence that the league as a whole is scoring less efficiently because of the false belief in the hot hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data says that players are essentially trading Restricted Area (.627 * 2 = 1.25 points per shot) and Corner 3 (.384 * 3 = 1.15 points per shot) attempts for Mid-Ranges (.398 * 2 = .796 points per shot) when they think they've got the &lt;em&gt;hot hand&lt;/em&gt;. That's clearly bad! If it happens once a game, that's 38 points a year lost, which might be enough to swing a game or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change in restricted area and in the paint (non-RA) FG% is intriguing, but if the hot hand did exist, wouldn't we see it on 3 point or mid-range shots, rather than restricted area shots? The announcer doesn't say "he's heating up" after a guy has made 3 layups in a row, they say it after 3 longer range shots in a row, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Higher volume players&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to focus on players with at least 1000 streaks, which leaves 630 players. Collectively, they are responsible for 84% of all shots in the NBA over the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their FG percentages are, on average, 1% lower when they are &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt; than when they are &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;68% of them shoot worse when they're hot than when they're cold, which is a pretty dramatic split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="fg-pct-hot-cold" src="/img/fg-pct-hot-cold.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a plot of the difference between hot and cold FG% versus z-score:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="z-score-hot-cold" src="/img/z-score-hot-cold.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players with negative values on the x axis shoot better when they're cold, and positive values shoot better when they're hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there should be some correlation between z-scores and hot/cold shooting tendency. I've shown simulations where a tendency to shoot &lt;em&gt;better cold&lt;/em&gt; produces unstreaky results (skewed towards positive z scores), and &lt;em&gt;better hot&lt;/em&gt; will produce streaky results (negative z scores). So there should be more dots in the upper left and bottom right quadrants compared to the other diagonal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if players behaved by coin flips, we should see roughly the same number of players with positive and negative z scores, and roughly the same number of players who shoot better when they're hot and better when they're cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I simulated all 3.5 million shots by these players, using their career average FG% for every shot. So any streakiness or unstreakiness is going to be totally random. As you can see, the data is much less spread out across both the X and Y axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="sim-z-hot-cold" src="/img/sim-z-hot-cold.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the crosstabs from the simulation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;better cold&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;better hot&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;margin&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;positive z&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;178&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;135&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;313&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;negative z&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;112&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;210&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;322&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;margin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;290&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;345&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As promised, the marginal values are pretty close to one another. That's what happens when "better hot" vs. "better cold" and "positive z" vs. "negative z" are determined purely by chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the actual crosstabs. The marginal values are much more imbalanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;better cold&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;better hot&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;margin&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;positive z&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;343&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;126&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;469&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;negative z&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;88&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;78&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;166&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;margin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;431&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;204&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things to note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;68% of the players shoot better when they're cold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;74% of the players have a positive z-score.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even among players with a negative z score, the majority of them shoot better when they're cold. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even among players that shoot better when they're hot, the majority of them &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; produce results that are less streaky than expected by chance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all super weird!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, these are just general trends. There are 78 players in the "better hot" + "negative z" box, and there should be around 210 players. We can't really say which players are the 130 "missing" players, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all I've got on the hot hand in the NBA for now. I think I understand it a lot better now, and I hope you do, too. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="sports analytics"></category><category term="basketball"></category><category term="the hot hand"></category></entry><entry><title>LeSimulation</title><link href="/lesimulation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-06-18T10:20:00-10:00</published><updated>2025-06-18T10:20:00-10:00</updated><author><name>casey durfee</name></author><id>tag:None,2025-06-18:/lesimulation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;(As usual, all code and notebooks are available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/hot_hand"&gt;https://github.com/csdurfee/hot_hand&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time, we saw that LeBron James was by far the un-streakiest player in the NBA over the last 20 years and found out that it's at least partly caused by shot selection. He takes both lower percentage shots than average when he's shooting well and higher percentage shots than average when he's shooting poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LeMartingale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the question of why it's OK to use a player's overall FG% to gauge their streakiness. We know that every shot a player takes has a slightly different level of difficulty, and thus a different probability that it will go in. Shouldn't that affect the streakiness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a good question.  Let's say you've got a bag with 2 types of coins inside. One of them comes up heads 40% of the time, the other comes up heads 60% of the time. You can't tell which is which. If you pick a coin randomly out of the bag and flip it, what are the chances, on average, it comes up heads? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's 50%, right? The selecting of the coin and the flipping of the coin are two independent steps. We can multiply the probabilities at each step together, so the overall chances of heads are &lt;code&gt;(.5 * .4) + (.5 * .6) = .5&lt;/code&gt;. If we kept randomly selecting from the bag and flipping a coin, the results would be indistinguishable from just flipping a single fair coin over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In math, this is known as a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(probability_theory)"&gt;Martingale&lt;/a&gt;. Previous outcomes don't give us information about the next event. (More in depth explanation &lt;a href="https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/pinewiki/Martingales.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  That's different from LeBron. We know he essentially chooses the 60% heads coin when he's been getting a lot of tails recently, and the 60% tails coin when he's been getting a lot of heads recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LeSimulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I create a simulation of LeBron James that uses his exact shooting tendencies and FG percentages, and the shot selection is totally random, it shouldn't show any streaky or unstreaky tendencies beyond expected by chance. Let's see what LeSimulation looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the last edition, I got LeBron's shooting stats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Above&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;Break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;344598&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Backcourt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;058824&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Paint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Non&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;RA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;401369&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Corner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;394799&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Mid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;379890&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Restricted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;720138&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Corner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;370370&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And shooting tendencies (what percent of the time he takes each type of shot):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Above&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;Break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;204940&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Backcourt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;001160&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Paint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Non&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;RA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;109652&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Corner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;014431&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Mid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;267715&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Restricted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;386442&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Corner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;015660&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simulation randomly chooses a shot type, based on the actual tendencies, then attempts a shot at the corresponding FG%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="le-fake-career" src="/img/le-fake-career.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The z-scores look like they should -- mean is very close to 0, standard deviation close to 1. No streaky/unstreaky tendencies, as promised. No evidence that shot attempts were at different FG%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LeSimulation 2 - last 5 FG%&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next simulation uses LeBron's FG% over his last 5 shots. We've seen he shoots the best with 0 makes in his last 5; the worst with 5 makes in his last 5. The simulation uses his exact percentages at each level. For the first 5 shots of every game, it uses his career FG%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran the simulation 1,000 times. Here are the z-scores:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="le-fake-career-2" src="/img/le-fake-career-2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, this simulation is pretty un-streaky:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's still not nearly as unstreaky as the man himself, though -- Lebron's z score of 5.9 would be way bigger than the largest value in 1,000 simulations (4.5). So he'd still be an outlier compared to these simulated un-streaky players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LeSimulation 3 -- No resetting streaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about a fake player where the streaks don't reset between games? That should make the simulated player even more unstreaky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this version of the simulation, every shot will be influenced by the FG% of the previous 5 shots, even if they happened in the previous game(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="le-fake-career-3" src="/img/le-fake-career-3.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the corresponding z-scores:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;count    1000.000000
mean        2.179821

max         5.073167
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the mean went from 1.6 to 2.2, and the max z score went from 4.5 to 5.1. That's still not nearly unstreaky enough to match LeReal LeBron, but at least it's closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible that if we tracked the last 7 shots, or 9, instead of 5, we would see even more of a dramatic change in FG percentage. Or there's some other factor I haven't considered that is adding unstreakiness, such as the fact that his FG percentage tends to go down the more shots he's taken in a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DoppLeGangers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was curious if I could find similar players to LeBron. There's a good way to do that, but I wanted to try my own way first. I found players where, like LeBron, their FG% steadily declines the more shots they've made out of the last 5.  There are 18 such players in the 2004-2024 years: Karl Malone (his last season), Grant Hill, Ben Wallace, Eddie House, Michael Redd, Jarvis Hayes, Andres Nocioni, JJ Redick, Nicolas Batum, Goran Dragic, DeMar DeRozan, Patrick Beverley, Marcus Morris Sr., Bradley Beal, Kelly Oubre Jr., Norman Powell, Donte DiVincenzo, and Landry Shamet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, these players have a mean z-score of 1.47, which is pretty impressive, but except for Goran Dragic, there isn't much overlap over the players with the highest overall z scores. 18 players is a pretty small sample size, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also looked at a broader set of players where at least 4 out of the 5 comparisons were decreasing. This gave 180 players, with an average z score of 1.0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;LeRight way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right way to identify LeBron-alikes is probably to use a similarity metric that I didn't invent. The fg percentages after 0,1,2...5/5 makes are sort of like a probability distribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In statistics and machine learning, we are often fitting a theoretical distribution to the actual observed data. Is it a good representation of the observed data? Do their distributions have the same sort of shape? The standard measure is relative entropy, also known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence"&gt;KL divergence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I normalize the shooting percentages and compare them to LeBron's, players with a low relative entropy should show the same tendency to shoot better when they're shooting worse than average over their last 5, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, LeBron's last 5 percentages are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.564612&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.50712&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.505937&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.496538&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.473849&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.464052&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By normalizing them, they act like a probability distribution (they all add up to one) but still have the same relative proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.187448&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.16836&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.167968&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.164847&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.157315&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.154062&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The normalization also corrects for the fact that shooters have different overall FG percentages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normalized values can then be compared to other players' values. The lower the entropy, the more similar their shapes are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also calculated the Jensen-Shannon distance, which is like relative entropy, but symmetrical (&lt;code&gt;distance(le_bron, le_other_guy) = distance(le_other_guy, le_bron)&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest guys to LeBron by this measure are CJ McCollum, Terry Rozier, Andrea Bargnani, Marcus Morris, Richard Hamilton, Nikola Vucevic, Zach Randolph, Lauri Markkanen, Kawhi Leonard, and Kevin Huerter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Richard Hamilton had the least streaky game in the last 20 years, it's not surpring to see him. But except for Randolph and Vucevic, none of the top 10 had exceptional z scores, though they were all positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jensen-Shannon distance results were extremely similar to entropy. It agreed exactly with the entropy on 73 of the top 100 players. The average z score for those players was 1.16, versus 1.15 for entropy. So, in aggregate, both were better than my homegrown metric at identifying unstreaky players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This graph shows the shape of the 10 players most similar to LeBron. They all have the same downward trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="most-similar-last5" src="/img/most-similar-last5.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't looked at whether the reason for the trend in last 5 FG% is due to shot selection for these other players, which is probably the interesting part. Some of the players flagged here are inevitably due to chance. It's based on six 50/50 measurements, so 1 in 64 players would get flagged as "LeBron like" even if the data was randomly generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of my queries here turned up the un-streakiest players like Luka Doncic and Anthony Edwards. Whatever causes their extreme unstreakiness (beyond randomness) must be different from LeBron's tendencies.

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="/tag/the-hot-hand.html"&gt;previous installments&lt;/a&gt;, I've shown that NBA players are, as a whole, less streaky than they should be. This is apparent in game-level data, and more obvious looking at multi season trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="/tag/the-hot-hand.html"&gt;previous installments&lt;/a&gt;, I've shown that NBA players are, as a whole, less streaky than they should be. This is apparent in game-level data, and more obvious looking at multi season trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I've only looked at the past four seasons of the NBA. I decided to look at every single shot taken in the NBA regular season from 2004 to 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is taken from &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/nba-shots"&gt;https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/nba-shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The streakiest games of the past 20 years&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I showed in the &lt;a href="/approximate-normality-and-continuity-corrections.html"&gt;last installment&lt;/a&gt;, there are two ways of measuring how relatively streaky each individual game is. We can use the normal approximation from the Wald-Wolfowitz test, or we can calculate the percentile ranks from the exact probabilities. The differences are negligible for whole seasons or careers, but they can be significantly different for individual games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They give different answers to what is the streakiest game of the past 20 years.  According to percentile rank, the streakiest ever was Cedi Osman, who in 2022 missed 10 shots in a row, followed by making 6 shots in a row, for an equivalent z-score of -3.6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the normal approximation, the streakiest game ever was Chris Bosh in 2007, who made 15 shots in a row before missing his final 4. Bosh doesn't even make the top 5 by percentile rank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other strong performances include Andre Iguodala, who had 16 straight misses followed by 3 makes in 2008, and Willie Green, who had 5 misses followed by 12 makes. The sheer length of those streaks is impressive, but to maximize the number of expected streaks, there need to be similar numbers of makes and misses. A game with 5 makes and 5 misses has a maximum of 10 streaks. A game with 15 makes and 4 misses, like Chris Bosh's 2007 performance, has a maximum of 9 streaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kobe Bryant's final game in the NBA also deserves mention. He went an extremely streaky 22 for 50, earning the highest number of expected streaks in the data I have (25.64): &lt;code&gt;11111000100110000101110000101100001100001111100000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The least streaky games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The least streaky was by Richard Hamilton in 2006, who had 10 makes and 13 misses, no two makes in a row: &lt;code&gt;01001010101010010101010&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyrie Irving, Dejounte Murray (previously covered), and Kevin Martin also had strong showings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The un-streaky GOAT&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 4th most un-streaky game of the past 20 years belongs to LeBron James.  &lt;a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200511090CLE.html"&gt;LeBron scored 31 points in an easy win over the SuperSonics in 2005&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from 2 makes in a row at the start of the game, he perfectly alternated makes and misses the rest of the game: &lt;code&gt;110101010101010101&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 20 years of shot data I analyzed, LeBron stands out as by far the most un-streaky player. Here are the career z scores of every player from 2004-2024:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="career-z-scores" src="/img/career-z-scores.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeBron can't even be seen on this chart. He is in a world of his own, with a career z score of 5.9. We have to go to the Jon Bois style scatterplot with one extreme outlier in the corner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="career-z-scatter" src="/img/career-z-scatter.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this were a Youtube video, imagine me zooming in on the solitary dot in the upper right while I play the hook from &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/BO1qcWa6blQ?t=22"&gt;Baker Street&lt;/a&gt; on a kazoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(While we're here, note the strong trend towards high volume shooters having positive z-scores. There is no player with over 6500 makes and a career negative z-score. Every single one of the ~25 people to hit that mark have a positive z-score.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What LeBron has done is really, really unlikely by chance alone. The odds are around 1 in 550 million. That puts him in the 99.9999998th percentile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all 8.2 Billion people on the planet had LeBron's NBA career, taking over 29,000 shots like he has, at the same FG% he did, we'd expect 15 people to be that unstreaky or more. That's elite company. Not only is LeBron James the LeBron James of basketball, he's also the LeBron James of being unstreaky at shooting the basketball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As both the most unstreaky player of all time, and the most prolific scorer of all time, LeBron James makes a perfect test subject for understanding unstreakiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's had 15,159 shooting streaks in his career so far, which is 504 more streaks than expected.  Say LeBron takes a low percentage shot because he feels like he has the hot hand. It might be a worse shot than usual, but it's probably not dramatically worse than his regular shot. Maybe it's a shot that goes in 40% of the time instead of 55%. So for him to have 500 more streaks than expected, that's potentially thousands of choices LeBron has made over his career that increased the likelihood of streaks getting broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Streak lengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I simulated LeBron's career 1000 times and compared the frequency of streak lengths to his actual career. Here are his actual streaks as a percentage of the simulated frequencies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="lebron-make-streaks" src="/img/lebron-make-streaks.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="lebron-miss-streaks" src="/img/lebron-miss-streaks.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has slightly more 1 and 2 shot make/miss streaks than expected, and fewer streaks of 5-6 or more. It's notable that it cuts both ways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously I discussed that players could cause unstreakiness because they &lt;em&gt;go get a bucket&lt;/em&gt; when the &lt;em&gt;shot isn't falling&lt;/em&gt; -- in other words, they take higher percentage shots when they're on a cold streak. They might try to draw contact from a defender, and if they do get fouled, it only counts as a shot attempt if the shot goes in, which makes it easier to break streaks of misses. On the other hand, they might take risky "heat check" shots when they are performing relatively well because they feel like they can't miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To capture &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt; versus &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt;, I decided to track the FG% over the previous 5 shots in the game. So, it's undefined for the player's first 5 shots of the game, then defined from the 6th on. Because LeBron is such a high volume scorer and has been for so many years, that's still a lot of data to look at. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here are the number of shot attempts by LeBron by each "last 5" shooting percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;NaN    7460
0.6    7222
0.4    6906
0.8    3518
0.2    3090
1.0     612
0.0     503
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have defined &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt; as making 0 or 1 of the last 5 shots, and &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt; as making 4 or 5 of the last 5. This was a semi-arbitrary choice based on make/miss streaks longer than 5 happening less frequently than chance would dictate. It also matches how my simulated un-streaky player works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a clear trend. LeBron's FG% is 10% higher when he's missed his last 5 shots than when he's made his last 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="lebron-last-5" src="/img/lebron-last-5.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a pretty big swing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LeBron is un-streaky due to shot selection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's behind this trend?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeBron takes a lot more high percentage shots when he's &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt; versus when he's &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;shot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;rates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;cold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;minus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;hot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Above&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;Break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;119694&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Backcourt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;               &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;001659&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Paint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Non&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;RA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;023637&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Corner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;000429&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Mid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;               &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;056841&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Restricted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;159098&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he's &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt;, he takes 29% of his shots in the restricted area (right near the basket, which is his highest percentage shot). When LeBron's &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt;, that jumps up to 45% of his shots. When he's hot, 29% of his shots are above the break 3's, but he only takes that shot 17% of the time when he's &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeBron's FG% for each type of shot doesn't change much between times when he's &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in between&lt;/em&gt;. He's a tiny bit better at corner 3's when he's cold vs. hot, but that's on very small volume. LeBron is usually attacking the middle of the court, not standing in the corner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeBron's actually slightly worse at his three most common shot types (above the break 3, mid-range, restricted area) when he's on a cold streak. He's not un-streaky because he suddenly becomes a better shooter when his shot hasn't been falling. He chooses to "go get a bucket" and seek out a higher percentage shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;FG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;cold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;minus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;hot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Above&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;Break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;036856&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Paint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Non&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;RA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;001647&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Corner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;026525&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Mid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;               &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;023709&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Restricted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;013754&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Corner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;157949&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like it cuts both ways. LeBron takes lower percentage shots when he's shooting well, and higher percentage shots when he's shooting poorly over the past 5 shots, compared to his average performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shot order trends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeBron's FG% appears to trend downward with the more shots that he takes in a game. The white line is his career average:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="seq-vs-fg" src="/img/seq-vs-fg.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't looked into it yet, but I suspect this is partially due to LeBron often taking the last shot of the game. Final shots of the game should be harder than average if it's a close game. Everybody knows the ball's going to LeBron for the final shot, so the defense is keying in on him. I'll save that for another installment, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other unstreaky guys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyle Kuzma, Julius Randle, Elton Brand, and Anthony Edwards are all in the 4+ z score club, with Luka Doncic, Giannis, John Henson, Goran Dragic, and Jordan Poole also in the top 10. Anthony Edwards is the most notable to me, because he's only played 5 seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan Poole is notable because he's kind of the whole reason I kept working on this project. Fans would probably think of him as a streaky shooter who can get "red hot", but he's actually one of the un-streakiest guys in the league. I feel like I know the whole story now: he behaves like the hot hand is real, but it isn't, and so he's less streaky than he should be, because this misplaced self-confidence leads him to take knucklehead shots. It's just a product of how our brains remember things. We remember him "getting hot" then taking some crazy shot that goes in. We, and he, don't remember him ruining a streak of makes that would happen by chance alone because of his dodgy shot selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;League-wide trends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back and did the same analysis for every non-LeBron shot over the last 20 years. The league as a whole doesn't show the same trends that LeBron does. FG% isn't correlated with number of makes out of the last 5. Here are the shooting percentages, graphed on the same scale as the one I used for LeBron:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="league-last-5" src="/img/league-last-5.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a very slight uptick when a player has made all 5 of their last 5 shots in the game, but otherwise it's remarkably flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the order of of shots taken, the NBA as a whole shows the same rough trend as LeBron's, though less dramatically. Lower FG% on the first shot of the game, and FG% slowly going down as the number of attempts goes up. (Again, I've locked the Y axis to match the scale of LeBron's.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="league-shot-seq" src="/img/league-shot-seq.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Streaky guys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's only one super streaky guy in the last 20 years, Ivica Zubac, with a Z score of -3.98. That's pretty crazy, but still plausibly within the realm of chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other guys with extremely streaky behavior on high volume are Dwight Powell, Nemanja Bjelica, Erick Dampier, Aaron Nesmith and Rudy Gobert, with z scores around -3. Most of those guys are big men who aren't primarily scorers. My hunch is that this is due to sequences where a big man will miss a shot close to the basket, get their own rebound, miss another shot, and so on. If so, these types of players will have longer miss streaks than make streaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I don't think there's a need to deeply analyze the streaky players at this point, because it could be due to chance alone. The big mystery has always been why there are way more un-streaky players than streaky ones. Both types should exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zydrunas Ilgauskas was a longtime player for the Cleveland Cavaliers who was nicknamed "The Big Z". However, his career z score was only 1.49, so I don't think it's a statistics based nickname. Which is too bad, because the game could use some of those. "Small Z" for Ivica Zubac's career -3.98 score might be confusing to people, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were LeBron's coach, I'd try to talk him out of believing he has the hot hand, because acting like it exists has caused him to be the most &lt;em&gt;lukewarm handed&lt;/em&gt; player of the past 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shot selection shouldn't change for the worse just because a player is shooting well. LeBron on a hot streak has roughly the same shooting percentages for each type of shot as when he's not on a hot streak, or when he's on a cold streak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His innate shooting skill doesn't change, he just takes lower percentage shots, perhaps believing they're not really lower percentage shots when he's &lt;em&gt;feeling it&lt;/em&gt;. It's feel vs. real, as it often is in sports, and life in general. Regardless of feel, they're still worse shots than he would normally take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going the other way, it's like the old joke -- why don't they build the whole airplane out of the black box? If LeBron has a higher shooting percentage when he's &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt; and decides to "go get a bucket", and that works, why doesn't he just do that on every play?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have a statistical answer to that question, but I do have a common sense one. In sports, part of the game is making the other team have to handle as many possibilities at a time. A quarterback in football shouldn't throw deep passes every play, because that's easy to defend when that's the only possible outcome. A baseball pitcher shouldn't just throw their best pitch every time, because that's easy for the hitter to anticipate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, LeBron probably shouldn't just put his head down and "get a bucket" every possession, because that's easy to plan against. LeBron wouldn't be an all time great if he only shot in the restricted area. While 3 pointers and midrange shots may have a lower expected value versus driving to the hoop, they force the defender to worry about LeBron no matter where he is on the court. LeBron can shoot or pass or just dribble right past the defender at any place on the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a hoops fan and a data nerd, I think trying to create a high percentage shot isn't a bad thing to do when a player is struggling in a game. That's especially true if a player can become less engaged in other aspects of the game when they are shooting poorly. A player taking low percentage &lt;em&gt;heat check&lt;/em&gt; shots because they are shooting well is much less forgivable, and should be coached out of players.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="sports analytics"></category><category term="basketball"></category><category term="the hot hand"></category></entry><entry><title>Approximate Normality and Continuity Corrections</title><link href="/approximate-normality-and-continuity-corrections.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-06-08T10:20:00-10:00</published><updated>2025-06-08T10:20:00-10:00</updated><author><name>casey durfee</name></author><id>tag:None,2025-06-08:/approximate-normality-and-continuity-corrections.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;(Notebooks and other code available at: &lt;a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/hot_hand"&gt;https://github.com/csdurfee/hot_hand&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is "approximately normal"?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last installment, I looked at NBA game-level player data, which involve very small samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of things in statistics, the Wald Wolfowitz test says that the number of streaks is approximately …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(Notebooks and other code available at: &lt;a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/hot_hand"&gt;https://github.com/csdurfee/hot_hand&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is "approximately normal"?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last installment, I looked at NBA game-level player data, which involve very small samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of things in statistics, the Wald Wolfowitz test says that the number of streaks is approximately normal. What does that mean in practical terms? How approximately are we talking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of streaks is a discrete value (0,1,2,3,...). In a small sample like 2 makes and 3 misses, which will be extremely common in player game level shooting data, how could that be &lt;em&gt;approximately normal&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a bar chart of the exact probabilities of each number of streaks, overlaid with the normal approximation in white. Not very normal, is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="not very normal" src="/img/not-very-normal.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make things more interesting, let's say the player made 7 shots and missed 4. That's enough for the graph to look more like a proper bell curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="exact 7-4 (or 4-7)" src="/img/exact-7-4.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bell curve looks skewed relative to the histogram, right? That's what happens when you model a discrete distribution (the number of streaks) with a continuous one -- the normal distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A continuous distribution has zero probability at any single point, so we calculate the area under the curve between a range of values. The bar for exactly 7 streaks should line up with the probability of between 6.5 and 7.5 streaks in the normal approximation. The curve should be going through the middle of each bar, not the left edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to shift the curve to the right a half a streak for things to line up. Fixing this is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_correction"&gt;continuity correction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the same graph with the continuity correction applied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="with cc" src="/img/with-cc.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... better, but there's still a problem. The normal approximation will assign a nonzero probability to impossible things. In this case of 7 makes and 4 misses, the minimum possible number of streaks is 2 and the max is 9 (alternate wins and losses till you run out of losses, then have a string of wins at the end.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the normal approximation says there's a nonzero chance of -1, 10, or even a million streaks. The odds are tiny, but the normal distribution never ends. These differences go away with big sample sizes, but they may be worth worrying about for small sample sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that interfering with my results? It's quite possible. I'm trying to use the mean and the standard deviation to decide how "weird" each player is in the form of a z score. The z score gives the likelihood of the data happening by chance, given certain assumptions. If the assumptions don't hold, the z score, and using it to interpret how &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; things are, is suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exact-ish odds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can easily calculate the exact odds. In the notebook, I showed how to calculate the odds with brute force -- generate all permutations of seven 1's and four 0's, and measure the number of streaks for each one. That's impractical and silly, since the exact counting formula can be worked out using the rules of combinatorics, as this page nicely shows:  &lt;a href="https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat415/lesson/21/21.1"&gt;https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat415/lesson/21/21.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to compare players with different numbers of makes and misses, we'd want to calculate a percentile value for each one from the exact odds. The percentiles will be based on number of streaks, so 1st percentile would be super streaky, 99th percentile super un-streaky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say we're looking at the case of 7 makes and 4 misses, and are trying to calculate the percentile value that should go with each number of streaks.  Here are the exact odds of each number of streaks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.006061&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.027273&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.109091&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.190909&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.272727&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.227273&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.121212&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.045455&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the cumulative odds (the odds of getting that number of streaks or fewer):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.006061&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.033333&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.142424&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.333333&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.606061&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.833333&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.954545&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.000000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say we get 6 streaks. Exactly 6 streaks happens 27% of the time. 5 or fewer streaks happens 33% of the time. So we could say 6 streaks is equal to the 33rd percentile, the &lt;code&gt;33.3%+27.3% = 61&lt;/code&gt;st percentile, or some value in between those two numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious way of deciding the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile_rank"&gt;percentile rank&lt;/a&gt; is to take the average of the upper and lower values, in this case &lt;code&gt;mean(.333, .606) = .47&lt;/code&gt;. You could also think of it as taking the probability of &lt;code&gt;streaks &amp;lt;=5&lt;/code&gt; and adding half the probability of &lt;code&gt;streaks=6&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to compare the percentile ranks from the exact odds to Wald-Wolfowitz, we could convert them to an equivalent z score. Or, we can take the z-scores from the Wald Wolfowitz test and convert them to percentiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two are bound to be a little different because the normal approximation is a bell curve, whereas we're getting the percentile rank from a linear interpolation of two values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an illustration of what I mean. This is a graph of the percentile ranks vs the CDF of the normal approximation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="cdf-normal-exact2" src="/img/cdf-normal-exact2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's zoom in on the section between 4.5 and 5.5 streaks. Where the white line hits the red line is the percentile estimate we'd get from the z-score (.475).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="cdf-zoom" src="/img/cdf-zoom.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green line is a straight line that represents calculating the percentile rank. It goes from the middle of the top of the &lt;code&gt;runs &amp;lt;= 5&lt;/code&gt; bar to the middle of the top of the &lt;code&gt;runs &amp;lt;=6&lt;/code&gt; bar. Where it hits the red line is the average of the two, which is percentile rank (.470).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other situations, the Wald-Wolfowitz estimate will be less than the exact percentile rank. We can see that on the first graph. The green lines and white line are very close to each other, but sometimes the green is higher (like at runs=4), and sometimes the white is higher (like at runs=8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is Wald-Wolfowitz unbiased?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. The test provides the exact expected value of the number of streaks. It's not just a pretty good estimate. It is the (weighted) mean of the exact probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the exact odds, the mean of all the streak lengths is 6.0909:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;count    330.000000
mean       6.090909
std        1.445329
min        2.000000
25%        5.000000
50%        6.000000
75%        7.000000
max        9.000000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wald-Wolfowitz test says the expected value is 1 plus the harmonic mean of 7 and 4, which is 6.0909... on the nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is the normal approximation throwing off my results?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite possibly. So I went back and calculated the percentile ranks for every player-game combo over the course of the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a scatter plot of the two ways to calculate the percentile on actual NBA player games. The dots above the x=y line are where the Wald-Wolfowitz percentile is bigger than the percentile rank one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="percentile-vs-ww" src="/img/percentile-vs-ww.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;59% of the time, the Wald-Wolfowitz estimate produces a higher percentile value than the percentile rank. The same trend occurs if I restrict the data set to only high volume shooters (more than 10 makes or misses on the game).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a bar chart of the differences between the W-W percentile and the percentile rank:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ww-minus-pr" src="/img/ww-minus-pr.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A percentile over 50, or a positive z score, means more streaks than average, thus less streaky than average. In other words, &lt;em&gt;on this specific data set&lt;/em&gt;, the Wald-Wolfowitz z-scores will be more un-streaky compared to the exact probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interlude: our un-streaky king&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, the un-streakiest NBA game of the 2023-24 season was by Dejounte Murray on 4/9/2024. My dude went 12 for 31 and managed 25 streaks, the most possible for that number of makes and misses, by virtue of never making 2 shots in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a crazy game all around for Murray. A 29-13-13 triple double with 4 steals, and a Kobe-esque 29 points on 31 shots. He could've gotten more, too. The game went to double overtime, and he missed his last 4 in a row. If he had made the 2nd and the 4th of those, he could've gotten 4 more streaks on the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summary of the game doesn't mention this exceptional achievement. Of course they wouldn't. There's no clue of it in the box score. You couldn't bet on it. Why would anyone notice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other end, the streakiest performance of the year belonged to Jabari Walker of the Portland Trail Blazers. Made his first 6 shots in a row, then missed his last 8 in a row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;z_from_percentile_rank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.403206&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Actual player performances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at actual NBA games where a player had exactly 7 makes and 4 misses. (We can also include the flip side, 4 makes and 7 misses, because it will be the same distribution of streak lengths)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green areas are where the players had more streaks than the exact probabilities; the red areas are where players had fewer streaks. The two are very close, except for a lot more games with 9 streaks in the player data, and fewer 6 streak games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact mean is 6.09 streaks. The mean for player performances is 6.20 streaks. Even in this little slice of data, there's a slight tendency towards unstreakiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="streaks-vs-probs" src="/img/streaks-vs-probs.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Percentile ranks are still unstreaky, though&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for all that windup, the game-level percentile ranks didn't turn out all that different when I calcualted them for all 18,000+ player-game combos. The mean and median are still shifted to the un-streaky side, to a significant degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="z-from-percentile" src="/img/z-from-percentile.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plotting the deciles shows an interesting tendency: a lot more values in the 60-70th percentile range than expected. the shift to the un-streaky side comes pretty much from these values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="perc-rank-deciles" src="/img/perc-rank-deciles.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bias towards the unstreaky side is still there, and still significant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;count    18982.000000
mean         0.039683

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A weird continuity correction that seems obviously bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAS, the granddaddy of statistics software, applies a continuity correction to the runs test whenever the count is less than 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's true that we should be careful with normal approximations and small sample size, this ain't the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact code used is here: &lt;a href="https://support.sas.com/kb/33/092.html"&gt;https://support.sas.com/kb/33/092.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;GE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Runs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;mu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;sigma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Runs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;mu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;LT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Runs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;mu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;sigma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Runs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;mu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;sigma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other implementations I looked at, like the one in R's &lt;a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/randtests/versions/1.0.1/topics/runs.test"&gt;&lt;code&gt;randtests&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/a&gt;, don't do the correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this sort of correction look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, it gives us something that doesn't look like a z score. The std is way too small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;count    18982.000000
mean        -0.031954
std          0.687916

25%         -0.401101
50%          0.000000
75%          0.302765
max          3.390395
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="sas-cc" src="/img/sas-cc.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What does this look like on random data?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could just be this dataset, though. I will generate a fake season of data like in the last installment, but the players will have no unstreaky/streaky tendencies. They will behave like a coin flip, weighted to their season FG%. So the results should be distributed like we expect z scores to be (mean=0, std=1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the z-scores. They're not obviously bad, but the center is a bit higher than it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="sas-sim" src="/img/sas-sim.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the continuity correction especially stands out when looking at small sample sizes (in this case, simulated players with fewer than 30 shooting streaks over the course of the season).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the below graph, red are the SAS corrected z-scores, green are the wald-wolfowitz z scores, brown are the overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="sas-low-vol" src="/img/sas-low-vol.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuity corrections are at best an imperfect substitute for calculating the exact odds. These days, there's no reason not to use exact odds for smaller sample sizes. Even though it ended up not mattering much, I should've started with the percentile rank for individual games. However, I don't think that the game level results are as important to the case I'm making as the career-long shooting results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time, I will look at the past 20 years of NBA data.

There's a bunch of stuff in the notebook about the Wald-Wolfowitz test that I will save for another week.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last installment, I was looking at season long shooting records from the NBA, and I concluded that NBA players were less streaky than expected. They have fewer long strings of makes and misses than a series of coin flips would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking this could be due to "heat check" shots -- a player has made a bunch of shots in a row, or are having a good shooting game in general, so they take harder shots than they normally take. 
It would explain some players that fans consider streaky or "heat check" players who are actually super un-streaky. Jordan Poole was the least streaky player over the last 4 seasons, which defies my expectations. Say he believes he is streaky, so tends to take bad shots when&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or it could be due to "get a bucket" shots -- a player is having a bad shooting game, so they force higher percentage shots and potentially free throws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a quirk of NBA stats to remember: if a player is fouled while shooting, it only counts as a field goal attempt if they make the shot. So driving to the hoop is guaranteed to not decrease a player's field goal percentage if they successfully draw a foul, or get called for an offensive foul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure I've made an airtight case for the &lt;em&gt;lukewarm hand&lt;/em&gt;. Combining every game in a season could hide the hot hand effect. What about individual games?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game-level shooting statistics show a lukewarm tendency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am using the complete shooting statistics available from this kaggle project: &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/nba-shots"&gt;https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/nba-shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking at the 2023-2024 season, since the current season isn't included yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through every game that every player played in the NBA season and calculated the expected vs. actual number of streaks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 24,895 player+game combos. 10,285 of them had more streaks than expected against 8,977 who had fewer streaks than expected (and around 5,000 that are exactly as expected). This is a significant imbalance towards the "lukewarm hand" side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the histogram of individual game z-scores:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="individual game z-scores, 2023" src="/img/game-zscores-2023.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limiting to higher volume games (at least 10 makes or 10 misses) shows the same tendency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;z_score&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dtype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;float64&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There definitely appears to be a bias towards the lukewarm hand in individual game data. The mean z scores aren't that much bigger than zero, but it's a huge sample size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Simulating streaky and non-streaky players&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I coded up a simulation of a non-streaky player. When they have hit a minimum number of attempts in the game, if their shooting percentage goes above a certain level, they get a penalty. If it goes below a certain level, they get a boost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to create results that look like NBA players in aggregate with an extremely simplified model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parameters were arbitrarily chosen. By default, the thresholds are 20% and 80%, and the boost/penalty is 20%. So a 50% shooter who has taken at least 4 shots and is shooting 80% or better for the game will get their FG% knocked down to 30% till their game percentage drops below the threshold. Likewise if they hit 20% or less, they get a boost until they're over the threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the game level shooting statistics I got for the individual game-by-game analysis. I then replayed every shot in the NBA in the 2023-24 season using the simulated lukewarm player (and the actual fg% and number of shots attempted in each game). This is what I got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="sim-z-scores" src="/img/sim-z-scores.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m m-Double"&gt;526.000000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;mean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m m-Double"&gt;0.218032&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m m-Double"&gt;0.965737&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m m-Double"&gt;2.397958&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m m-Double"&gt;0.491051&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m m-Double"&gt;0.241554&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;75&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m m-Double"&gt;0.836839&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m m-Double"&gt;3.787951&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;z_score&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dtype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;float64&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My simulation was actually less biased to the right than the actual results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="actual-2023-24" src="/img/actual-2023-24.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several big things to note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I simulated every player in the league as being a little un-streaky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I simulated them being un-streaky in both directions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The boost/penalty are pretty big -- going from 50% FG percentage to 30% is going from a good NBA player to a bad college player level, and the boost to 70% FG percentage has no precedent. The most accurate shooters in the NBA are usually big men who only shoot dunks and layups, and they still usually end up in the 60-65% range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is to say, my simulation is kind of silly and seemingly over-exaggerated. And it's still not as lukewarm as real NBA players are.  Wild, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Streakiness in only one direction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also simulated players who were only streaky in one direction: "get a bucket" players who get a boost to shooting percentage when they are shooting poorly, but no penalty when they are doing well, and "heat check" players who only get the penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were biased to the unstreaky side, but about half as much as the ones that are streaky in both directions. I had to crank the penalties/boosts up to unrealistic levels to get the bias of the z-scores up to the .2-.3 range I'm seeing with real season-level data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The truly streaky player&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I had to simulate the hot hand. The &lt;code&gt;TrulyStreakyPlayer&lt;/code&gt; is the exact opposite of the &lt;code&gt;LukewarmPlayer&lt;/code&gt;. They get a 20% boost when they're shooting well on the game, and a 20% penalty when they're shooting poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What stands out to me here is how much it affects the z-score. I was expecting the z-scores to be biased to the negative side by about as much as the unstreaky player was to the positive side. But the effect was a lot more dramatic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;count    524.000000
mean      -0.455522
std        1.144570
min       -4.413268
25%       -1.225128
50%       -0.458503
75%        0.404549
max        2.486584
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="truly-streaky-player" src="/img/truly-streaky-player.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the un-streaky simulations, the streaky behavior increased the dispersion (&lt;code&gt;std&lt;/code&gt;), like we saw with the real shot data. There are many more outliers to the negative side than we'd expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could certainly sim a mixture of streaky and unstreaky players, and eventually maybe get something that matches the real numbers pretty closely. But there are so many parameters to fit that it would be pretty arbitrary. Someone else could produce a different model that works just as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, it couldn't tell us which players might be streaky due to chance versus streaky due to behavior/shot selection. So I think the next step is looking at the shot selection in the "hot hand" vs. "get a bucket" situations -- do players switch to higher percentage shots when they're having a bad game, and worse shots when they're shooting better than usual?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="sports analytics"></category><category term="basketball"></category><category term="the hot hand"></category></entry><entry><title>What are the most important events at the NFL Combine?</title><link href="/what-are-the-most-important-events-at-the-nfl-combine.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-05-23T10:20:00-10:00</published><updated>2025-05-23T10:20:00-10:00</updated><author><name>casey durfee</name></author><id>tag:None,2025-05-23:/what-are-the-most-important-events-at-the-nfl-combine.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;(the code used is available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/nfl_combine_data/"&gt;https://github.com/csdurfee/nfl_combine_data/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, the National Football League hosts an event called the Combine, where teams can evaluate the top prospects before the upcoming draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Athletes are put through a series of physical and mental tests over the course of …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(the code used is available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/nfl_combine_data/"&gt;https://github.com/csdurfee/nfl_combine_data/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, the National Football League hosts an event called the Combine, where teams can evaluate the top prospects before the upcoming draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Athletes are put through a series of physical and mental tests over the course of four days. There is a lot of talk of hand size, arm length, and whether a guy looks athletic enough when he's running with his shirt off. It's basically the world's most invasive job interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFL teams have historically put a lot of stock in the results of the combine. A good showing at the combine can improve a player's career prospects, and a bad showing can significantly hurt them. For that reason, some players will opt out of attending the combine, but that can backfire as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was curious about which events in the combine correlate most strongly with draft position. There are millions of dollars at stake. The first pick in the NFL draft gets a $43 Million dollar contract, the 33rd pick gets $9.6 Million, and the 97th pick gets $4.6 Million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main events of the combine are the 40 yard dash, vertical leap, bench press, broad jump, 3 cone drill and shuttle drill. The shuttle drill and the 3 cone drill are pretty similar -- a guy running between some cones as fast as possible. The other drills are what they sound like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm taking the data from Pro Football Reference. Example page: &lt;a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/draft/2010-combine.htm"&gt;https://www.pro-football-reference.com/draft/2010-combine.htm&lt;/a&gt;. I'm only looking at players who got drafted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Position Profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes no sense to compare a cornerback's bench press numbers to a defensive lineman's. There are vast differences in the job requirements. A player in the combine is competing against other players at the same position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graph shows a position's performance on each exercise relative to all players. The color indicates how the position as a whole compares to the league as a whole. You can change the selected position with the dropdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="/img/position_view_2025.html" width="550" height="450" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cornerbacks are exceptional on the 40 yard dash and shuttle drills compared to NFL athletes as a whole, whereas defensive linemen are outliers when it comes high bench press numbers, and below average at every other event. Tight Ends and Linebackers are near the middle in every single event, which makes sense because both positions need to be strong enough to deal with the strong guys, and fast enough to deal with the fast guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Importance of Events by Position&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I analyzed how a player's performance relative to others at their position correlates with draft rank. Pro-Football-Reference has combine data going back to 2000.  I have split the data up into 2000-2014 and 2015-2025 to look at how things have changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each position, the exercises are ranked from most to least important. The tooltip gives the exact r^2 value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the results up to 2014:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="/img/before_2015.html" width="800" height="700" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the last 10 years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="/img/after_2015.html" width="800" height="700" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things I notice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main combine events matter that much either way for offensive and defensive linemen. That's held true for 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shuttle and 3 cone drill have gone up significantly in importance for tight ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broad jump and 40 yard dash are important for just about every position. However, the importance of the 40 yard dash time has gone down quite a bit for running backs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a fan, it used to be a huge deal when a running back posted an exceptional 40 yard time. It seemed Chris Johnson's legendary 4.24 40 yard time was referenced every year. But I remember there being lot of guys who got drafted in the 2000's primarily based on speed who turned out to not be very good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bench press is probably the least important exercise across the board. There's almost no correlation between performance and draft order, for every position. Offensive and defensive linemen basically bench press each other for 60 minutes straight; for everybody else, that sort of strength is less relevant.  Here's one of the greatest guys at throwing the football in human history, Tom Brady:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="behold" src="/img/Tom-Brady-Combine.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to all quarterbacks who have been drafted since 2000, Brady's shuttle time was in the top 25%, his 3 cone time was in the top 50%, and his broad jump, vertical leap and 40 yard dash were all in the bottom 25%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changes in combine performance over time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Athlete performance has changed over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've plotted average performance by year for each of the events. For the 40 yard dash, shuttle, and 3 cone drills, lower is better, and for the other events, higher is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="change over time" src="/img/combine-trends.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;40 yard dash times and broad jump distances have clearly improved, whereas shuttle times and bench press reps have gotten slightly worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a cliche in sports that "you can't coach speed".  While some people are innately faster than others, the 40 yard dash is partly a skill exercise -- learning to get off the block as quickly as possible without faulting, for starters. The high priority given to the 40 yard dash should lead to prospects practicing it more, and thus getting better numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bench press should be going down or staying level, since it's not very important to draft position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's been a significant improvement in the broad jump - about 7.5% over 25 years. As with the 40 yard dash, I'd guess it's better coaching and preparation. Perhaps it's easier to improve than some of the other events. I don't think there's more broad jumping in an NFL game than there was 25 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shuttle times getting slightly worse is a little surprising. It's very similar to the 3 Cone drill, which has slightly improved. But as we saw, neither one is particularly important as far as draft position, and it's not a strong trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best athletes skip the combine entirely, because their draft position is already secure. And some athletes will only choose to do the exercises they think they will do well at, and skip their weak events. This is known as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493614/"&gt;MNAR data&lt;/a&gt; (missing, not at random). All analysis of MNAR data is potentially biased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming a linear relationship between draft position and performance. It's possible that a good performance helps more than a bad performance hurts, or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't calculate statistical significance for anything. Some correlations will occur even in random data. This isn't meant to be rigorous.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="sports analytics"></category><category term="football"></category></entry><entry><title>Majority Voting in Ensemble Learning</title><link href="/majority-voting-in-ensemble-learning.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-05-22T10:20:00-10:00</published><updated>2025-05-22T10:20:00-10:00</updated><author><name>casey durfee</name></author><id>tag:None,2025-05-22:/majority-voting-in-ensemble-learning.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;(notebook is available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/ensemble_learning/blob/main/ensemble_voting.ipynb"&gt;github.com/csdurfee/ensemble_learning&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ensemble Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI and machine learning systems are often used for classification. Is this email spam or not? Is this person a good credit risk or not? Is this a photo of a cat or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of ways …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(notebook is available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/ensemble_learning/blob/main/ensemble_voting.ipynb"&gt;github.com/csdurfee/ensemble_learning&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ensemble Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI and machine learning systems are often used for classification. Is this email spam or not? Is this person a good credit risk or not? Is this a photo of a cat or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of ways to build classifiers, and they all potentially have different strengths and weaknesses. It's natural to try combining multiple models together to produce better results than the individual models would. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Model A might be bad at classifying black cats but good at orange ones, model B might be bad at classifying orange cats but good at black ones, model C is OK at both. So if we average together the results of the three classifiers, or go with the majority opinion between them, the results might be better than the individual classifiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called an ensemble. Random forests and gradient boosting are two popular machine learning techniques that use ensembles of &lt;em&gt;weak learners&lt;/em&gt; -- a large number of deliberately simple models that are all trained on different subsets of the data. This strategy can lead to systems that are more powerful than their individual components. While each little tree in a random forest is weak and prone to overfitting, the forest as a whole can be robust and give high quality predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Majority Voting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also create ensembles of &lt;em&gt;strong learners&lt;/em&gt; -- combining multiple powerful models together. Each individual model is powerful enough to do the entire classification on its own, but we hope to achieve higher accuracy by combining their results.  The most common way to do that is with voting. Query several classifiers, and have the ensemble return the majority pick, or otherwise combine the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some characteristics of ensembles that seem pretty common sense [1]. The classifiers in the ensemble need to be &lt;em&gt;diverse&lt;/em&gt;: as different as possible in the mistakes they make. If they all make the same mistakes, then there's no way for the ensemble to correct for that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more classification categories, the more classifiers are needed in the ensemble. However, in real world settings, there's usually a point where adding more classifiers doesn't improve the ensemble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="model"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like building really simple models. They can illustrate fundamental characteristics, and show what happens at the extremes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I created an extremely simple model of majority voting (see &lt;a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/ensemble_learning/blob/main/ensemble_voting.ipynb"&gt;notebook&lt;/a&gt;). I'm generating a random list of 0's and 1's, indicating the ground truth of some binary classification problem. Then I make several copies of the ground truth and randomly flip &lt;code&gt;x%&lt;/code&gt; of the bits. Each of those copies represent the responses from an individual classifier within the ensemble. Each fake classifier will have &lt;code&gt;100-x%&lt;/code&gt; accuracy. There's no correlation between the wrong answers that each classifier gives, because the changes were totally random. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every pair of fake classifiers with 60% accuracy, they will both be right &lt;code&gt;60% * 60% = 36%&lt;/code&gt; of the time, and both wrong &lt;code&gt;40% * 40% = 16%&lt;/code&gt;. So they will agree &lt;code&gt;36% + 16% = 52%&lt;/code&gt; of the time at minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's different from the real world. Machine learning algorithms trained on the same data will make a lot of the same mistakes and get a lot of the same questions right. If there are outliers in the data, any classifier can overfit on them. And they're all going to find the same basic trends in the data. If there aren't a lot of good walrus pictures in the training data, every model is probably going to be bad at recognizing walruses. There's no way to make up for what isn't there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Theory vs Reality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the real world, there seem to be limits on how much an ensemble can improve classification. On paper, there are none, as the simulation shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the probability of the ensemble being wrong about a particular classification?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the probability that the majority of the classifiers predict 0, given that the true value is 1 (and vice versa). If each classifier is more likely to be right than wrong, as the number of classifiers goes to infinity, the probability of the majority of predictions being wrong goes to 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If each binary classifier has a probability &amp;gt; .5 of being right, we can make the ensemble arbitrarily precise if we add enough classifiers to the ensemble (assuming their errors are independent). We could grind the math using the normal approximation to get the exact number if need be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say each classifier is only right 50.5% of the time. We might have to add 100,000 of them to the ensemble, but we can make the error rate arbitrarily small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Correlated errors ruin ensembles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big difference between my experiment and reality is that the errors the fake classifiers make are totally uncorrelated with each other. I don't think that would ever happen in the real world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more the classifiers' wrong answers are correlated with each other, the less useful the ensemble becomes. If they are 100% correlated with each other, the ensemble will give the exact same results as the individual classifiers, right? An ensemble doesn't &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; improve results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it in human terms, the "wisdom of the crowd" comes from people in the crowd having wrong beliefs about uncorrelated things (and being right more often than not overall). If most people are wrong in the same way, there's no way to overcome that with volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience has been that different models tend to make the same mistakes, even if they're using very different AI/machine learning algorithms, and a lot of that is driven by weaknesses in the training data used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a more realistic scenario, I created fake classifiers with correlated answers, so that they agree with the ground truth 60% of the time, and with each other 82% of the time, instead of the minimum 52% of the time. 
The Cohen kappa score is .64, on a scale from -1 to 1, so they aren't as correlated as they could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simulation shows that if the responses are fairly strongly correlated with each other, there's a hard limit to how much the ensemble can improve things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with 99 classifiers in the ensemble, the simulation only achieves an f1 score of .62. That's just a slight bump from the .60 achieved individually. There is no marginal value to adding more than 5 classifiers to the ensemble at this level of correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ensembles: The Rich Get Richer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen voting ensembles suggested for especially tricky classification problems, where the accuracy of even the  best models is pretty low. I haven't found that to be true, though, and the simulation backs that up. Ensembles are only going to give a significant boost for binary classification if the individual classifiers are significantly better than 50% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more accurate the individual classifiers, the bigger the boost from the ensemble. These numbers are for an ensemble of 3 classifiers (in the ideal case of no correlation between their responses):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hard vs. soft voting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two different ways of doing majority voting, hard and soft. This choice can have an impact on how well an ensemble works, but I haven't seen a lot of guidance on when to use each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hard voting&lt;/em&gt; is where we convert the outputs of each binary classifier into a boolean yes/no, and go with the majority opinion. If there are an odd number of components and it's a binary classification, there's always going to be a clear winner. That's what I've been simulating so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soft voting&lt;/em&gt; is where we combine the raw outputs of all the components, and then round the combined result to make the prediction. &lt;a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.VotingClassifier.html#sklearn.ensemble.VotingClassifier"&gt;sklearn's documentation&lt;/a&gt; advises to use soft voting "for an ensemble of well-calibrated classifiers".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the real world, binary classifiers don't return a nice, neat 0 or 1 value. They return some value between 0 or 1 indicating a relative level of confidence in the prediction, and we round that value to 0 or 1. A lot of models will never return a 0 or 1 -- for them, nothing is impossible, just extremely unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a classifier returns &lt;code&gt;.2&lt;/code&gt;, we can think of it as the model giving a &lt;code&gt;20%&lt;/code&gt; chance that the answer is &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and an &lt;code&gt;80%&lt;/code&gt; chance it's &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. That's not really true, but the big idea is that there's potentially additional context that we're throwing away by rounding the individual results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, say the raw results are &lt;code&gt;[.3,.4,.9]&lt;/code&gt;. With hard voting, these would get rounded to &lt;code&gt;[0,0,1]&lt;/code&gt;, so it would return &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. With soft voting, it would take the average of &lt;code&gt;[.3,.4,.9]&lt;/code&gt;, which is &lt;code&gt;.53&lt;/code&gt;, which rounds to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. So the two methods can return different answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To emulate the soft voting case, I flipped a percentage of the bits, as before. Then I replaced every 0 with a number chosen randomly from the uniform distribution from &lt;code&gt;[0,.5]&lt;/code&gt; and every &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; with a sample from &lt;code&gt;[.5,1]&lt;/code&gt;. The values will still round to what they did before, but there's additional noise on top. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this simulation (3 classifiers), the soft voting ensemble gives less of a boost than the hard voting ensemble -- about half the benefits. As with hard voting, the more accurate the individual classifiers are, the bigger the boost the ensemble gives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Classifier Accuracy&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Ensemble Accuracy&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td&gt;56%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;60%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;62%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;70%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;74%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;80%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;85%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say a classifier returns &lt;code&gt;.21573&lt;/code&gt; and I round that down to 0. How much of the &lt;code&gt;.21573&lt;/code&gt; that got lost was noise, and how much was signal? If a classification task is truly binary, it could be all noise. Let's say we're classifying numbers as odd or even. Those are unambiguous categories, so a perfect classifier should always return exactly 0 or 1. It shouldn't say that three is odd, with 90% confidence. In that case, it clearly means the classifier is 10% wrong. There's no good reason for uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, say we're classifying whether photos contain a cat or not. What if a cat is wearing a walrus costume in one of the photos? Shouldn't the classifier return a value greater than 0 for the possibility of it not being a cat, even if there really is a cat in the photo? Isn't it somehow less cat-like than another photo where it's not wearing a walrus costume? In this case, the &lt;code&gt;.21573&lt;/code&gt; at least partially represents signal, doesn't it? It's saying "this is pretty cat-like, but not as cat-like as another photo that scored &lt;code&gt;.0001&lt;/code&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I'm adding noise to emulate the soft voting case, is that &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt;? A different way of fuzzing the numbers (selecting the noise from a non-uniform distribution, for instance) might reduce the gap in performance between hard and soft voting ensembles, and it would probably be more realistic. But the point of a model like this is to show the extremes -- it's possible that hard voting will give better results than soft voting, so it's worth testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Big Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensembles aren't magic; they can only improve things significantly if the underlying classifiers are diverse and fairly accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard and soft voting aren't interchangeable. If there's a lot of random noise in the responses, hard voting is probably a better option, otherwise soft voting is probably better. It's definitely worth testing both options when building an ensemble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone thinking of using an ensemble should look at the amount of correlation between the responses from different classifiers. If the classifiers are all making basically the same mistakes, an ensemble won't help regardless of hard vs. soft voting. If models with very different architectures are failing in the same ways, that could be a weakness in the training data that can't be fixed by an ensemble.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Streaks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I'm watching a basketball game, sometimes it seems like a certain player just can't miss. Every shot looks like it's going to go in. Other times, it seems like they've gone cold. They can't get a shot to go in no matter what they do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon is known as the "hot hand" and whether it exists or not has been debated for decades, even as it's taken for granted in the common language around sports. We're used to commentators saying that a player is  "heating up", or, "that was a heat check".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a fan of the game, it certainly seems like the hot hand exists. If you follow basketball, some names probably come to mind. JR Smith, Danny Green, Dion Waiters, Jamal Crawford. When they're on, they just can't miss. It doesn't matter how crazy the shot is, it's going in. And when they're cold, they're &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a thing we collectively believe in, but it turns out that there isn't clear statistical evidence to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to be careful with our feelings about the hot hand. It certainly feels real, but that doesn't mean that it is. Within the drama of a basketball game, we're inclined to notice and assign stories to runs of makes or misses. Just because we notice them, that doesn't mean they're significant. This is sometimes called "the law of small numbers" -- our brains have a tendency to reach spurious conclusions from a very small amount of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia"&gt;Pareidolia&lt;/a&gt; is the human tendency to see human faces in inanimate objects -- clouds, the bark of a tree, a tortilla. While the faces might seem real, they are just a product of our brain's natural inclination to identify patterns. It's possible the "hot hand" is a similar phenomenon -- a product of the way human brains are wired to see patterns, rather than an objective truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defining Streakiness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streaks of 1's and 0's in randomly generated binary data follow regular mathematical laws, ones our brains can't realy replicate. Writer &lt;a href="https://www.football-data.co.uk/blog/Wald_Wolfowitz.php"&gt;Joseph Buchdal&lt;/a&gt; found that he couldn't create a random-looking sequence by hand that would fool a statistical test called the Wald-Wolfowitz test, even though he knew exactly how the statistical test worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think at some level, we're physically incapable of generating truly random data, so it makes sense to me that our intuitions about randomness are a little off. Our brains are wired to notice the streaks, but we seem to have no such circuitry for noticing when something is a little bit too un-streaky. Our brains are too quick to see meaningless patterns in small amounts of data, and not clever enough to see subtle, meaningful patterns in large amounts of data. Good thing we have statistics to help us escape those biases!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of this discussion, a streak starts whenever a sequence of outcomes changes from wins (W) to losses (L), or vice-versa. (I'm talking about makes and misses, but those start with the same letter, so I'll use "W" and "L".)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sequence &lt;code&gt;WLWLWL&lt;/code&gt; has 6 streaks: &lt;code&gt;W, L, W, L, W, L&lt;/code&gt;      &lt;br&gt;
The sequence &lt;code&gt;WWLLLW&lt;/code&gt; has 3 streaks: &lt;code&gt;WW, LLL, W&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine I asked someone to produce a random-looking string of 3 W's and 3 L's. If they were making the results up, I think the average person would be more likely to write the first string. It just looks "more random", right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they flipped a coin, it would be more likely to produce something with longer streaks, like the second example. With a fair coin, both of those &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; sequences are equally likely to occur. But the second sequence has a more probable number of streaks, according to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wald%E2%80%93Wolfowitz_runs_test"&gt;Wald-Wolfowitz Runs Test&lt;/a&gt;. The expected number in 3 wins and 3 losses is (2 * (3 * 3) / (3+3)) + 1 = 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expected number of streaks is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean"&gt;harmonic mean&lt;/a&gt; of the number of wins and the number of losses, plus one. Neat, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 500 players attempted a shot in the NBA this season. Let's say we create a custom coin for each player. It comes up heads with the same percentage as the player's shooting percentage on the season. If we took those coins and simulated every shot in the NBA this season, some of the coins would inevitably appear to be "streakier" than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players never intend to miss shots, yet most players shoot around 50%, so there has to be some element of chance as far as which shots go in or not. Otherwise, why wouldn't players just choose to make all of them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So makes versus misses are at least somewhat random, which means if we look at the shooting records of 500 players in an NBA season, some will seem more or less consistent due to the laws of probability. That means a player with longer or shorter streaks than expected could just be due to chance, not due to the player actively doing something that makes them more streaky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Lukewarm Hand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might call players who have fewer streaks than expected by chance &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe they go exactly 5 for 10 every single game, never being especially good or especially bad. Or maybe they go 1 for 3 every game, always being pretty bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that feels like the wrong word, and I don't think our brains aren't really wired to notice a player that has fewer streaks than average. As we already saw, the "right" number of streaks is counterintuitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might notice a player is unusually consistent after the fact when looking at their basketball-reference page, but the feeling of a player having the &lt;em&gt;hot hand&lt;/em&gt; is visceral, experienced in the moment. Even without consulting the box score, sometimes players look like they just can't miss, or can't make, a shot. They seem more confident, or their shot seems more natural, than usual. Both the shooter and the spectator seem to have a higher expectation that the shot will go in than usual. The hot hand is a social phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="there's always an xkcd" src="/img/xkcd-sports.png"&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
(from &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/904/"&gt;https://xkcd.com/904/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at the makes and misses of every player in the league, do they look like the results of flipping a coin (weighted to match their shooting percentage), or is there a tendency for players to be more or less streaky than expected by chance? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't really have a formal word for players who are less streaky than they should be, so I'm going to call the opposite of the &lt;em&gt;hot hand&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;lukewarm hand&lt;/em&gt;. While the &lt;em&gt;lukewarm hand&lt;/em&gt; isn't a thing we would viscerally notice the way we do the &lt;em&gt;hot hand&lt;/em&gt;, it's certainly possible to exist. And it's just as surprising, from the perspective of treating basketball players like weighted coins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people I've seen analyze the hot hand treat the question as &lt;em&gt;streaky&lt;/em&gt; versus &lt;em&gt;non-streaky&lt;/em&gt;. But it's not a binary thing. There are two possible extremes, and a region in between. It's &lt;em&gt;unusually streaky&lt;/em&gt; versus &lt;em&gt;normal amount of streaky&lt;/em&gt; versus &lt;em&gt;unusually non-streaky&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wald-Wolfowitz test says that the number of streaks in randomly-generated data will be normally distributed, and gives a formula for the variance of the number of streaks. The normal distribution is symmetrical, so there should be as many &lt;em&gt;hot hand&lt;/em&gt; players as &lt;em&gt;lukewarm hand&lt;/em&gt; ones. Players have varying numbers of shots taken over the course of the season so we can't compare them directly, but we can calculate the z score for each player's expected vs. actual number of streaks. The z score represents how "weird" the player is. If we look at all the z-scores together, we can see whether NBA players as a whole are streakier or less streaky than chance alone would predict. We can also see if the outliers correspond to the popular notions of who the streaky shooters in the NBA are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Simplifying Assumptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should start with the assumption that athletes really are weighted random number generators. A coin might have "good days" and "bad days" based on the results, but it's not because the coin is "in the zone" one day, or a little injured the next day. At least some of the variance in a player's streakiness is due to randomness, so we have to be looking for effects that can't be explained by randomness alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I am analyzing all shots a player took, across all games. This could cause problems, which I will discuss later on, but splitting the results up game-by-game or week-by-week leads to other problems. Looking at shooting percentages by game or by week means smaller sample sizes, and thus more sampling error. It also means that comparisions between high volume shooters and low volume shooters can be misinterpreted. The high volume shooters may appear more "consistent" simply because it's a larger sample size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I need to prove that &lt;em&gt;streakiness&lt;/em&gt; exists before making assumptions about how it works. Let's say the "hot hand" does exist. If a player makes a bunch of shots in a row, how long might they stay hot? Does it last through halftime? Does it carry over to the next game? How many makes in a row before they "heat up"? How much does a player's field goal percentage go up? Does a player have cold streaks and hot streaks, or are they only streaky in one direction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are an infinite number of ways to model how it could work, which means it's ripe for overfitting. So I wanted to start with the simplest, most easily justifiable model. The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0010028585900106?via%3Dihub"&gt;original paper about the hot hand&lt;/a&gt; was co-written by Amos Tversky, who went on to win a Nobel Prize for helping to invent behavioral economics. I figure any time you can crib off of a Nobel Prize winner's homework, you probably should!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off by getting data on every shot taken in the 2024-25 NBA regular season. I calculated the expected number of streaks and actual number, then a z-score for every player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players with a z-score of 0 are just like what we'd expect from flipping a coin. A positive z-score indicates there were more streaks than expected. More streaks than expected means the streaks were shorter than expected, which means less streaky than expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A negative z-score indicates the opposite. Those players had fewer streaks than expected, which means the streaks were longer.  When people talk about the "hot hand" or "streaky shooters", they are talking about players who should have a negative z-score by this test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="all players, 2024-5" src="/img/all-players-2024.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curve over the top is the distribution of z-scores we'd expect if the players worked like weighted coin flips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just eyeballing it, it's pretty close. It's definitely a bell curve, centered pretty close to zero. If there is a skew, it's actually to the positive, un-streaky side, though.  The mean z-score is .21, when we'd expect it to be zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;count    554.000000

&lt;p&gt;The Wilk-Shapiro test is way to decide whether a set of data plausibly came from a normal distribution. It passed. There is no conclusive evidence that players in general are streakier or less streaky than predicted by chance. This data very well could've come from flipping a bunch of coins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's still sorta skewed. There were 320 players with a positive z-score (un-streaky) versus 232 with a negative z-score (streaky). That's suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outliers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A whole lot of those 554 players didn't make very many shots.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="numer of makes, 2024-5" src="/img/makes-2024.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to split up players with over 100 makes versus under 100 makes. Unlike high volume shooters, the low volume shooters had no bias towards unstreakiness. They look like totally random data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are just the high volume shooters (323 players in total). Notice how none of them have a z-score less than about -2. It should be symmetrical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="over 100 makes, 2024-5" src="/img/over-100-makes.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Eye Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at which players had exceptionally high or low z scores. The names don't really make sense to me as an NBA fan. There were players like Jordan Poole and Jalen Green, who I think fans would consider streaky, but they had exceptionally un-streaky z-scores. I don't think the average NBA fan would say Jalen Green is less streaky than 97.5% of the players in the league, but he is (by this test).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, two streakiest players in the NBA this year were Goga Bitadze and Thomas Bryant, two players who don't fit the profile of the stereotypical streaky shooter by any means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Makes vs. Streakiness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more shots a player made this season, the more un-streaky they tended to be. Here's a plot of makes on the 2024-25 season versus the z-score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="makes vs z-score" src="/img/makes-vs-zscore.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's pretty odd, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting more data: 2021-present&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured a bigger sample size would be better. Maybe this season was just weird. So got the last 4 seasons of data (2021-22, 2022-2023, 2023-2024, 2024-2025) for players who made a shot in the NBA this season and combined them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four year data is even more skewed towards the &lt;em&gt;lukewarm hand&lt;/em&gt;, or un-streaky side, than the single year data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="all players, 2021-2025" src="/img/all-players-four-year.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;count    562.000000

75%        1.184918
max        4.184025
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The correlation between number of makes and z-score is quite strong in the 4 year data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2021-2025 z score vs makes" src="/img/four-year-makes-vs-zscore.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 48 players with a z-score &amp;gt; 2, versus only 9 with a score &amp;lt; -2. That's like flipping a coin and getting 48 heads and 9 tails. There's around a 2 in 10 million chance of that happening with a fair coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High Volume Shooters, Redux&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bias towards the lukewarm hand is even stronger among high volume shooters. Here are players with more than 500 makes over the past 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="over 500 makes" src="/img/over-500-makes.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The z-scores are normally distributed according to the Wilk-Shapiro test, but they're no longer even close to being centered at zero. They're also overdispersed (the std is bigger than the expected 1.) It's not plausible that the true mean is 0, given the sample mean is .680.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="high volume hist" src="/img/high-volume-hist.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Streak Lengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at the length of make/miss streaks for the actual NBA players versus simulating the results. The results were simulated by taking the exact number of makes and misses for each NBA player, and then shuffling those results randomly. What I found confirmed the "lukewarm hand" -- overall, NBA players have slightly more 1 and 2 shot streaks than expected, and fewer long streaks than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="streaks" src="/img/streaks.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Obvious objections, and what about free throws?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm treating every field goal attempt like it has the same chance of going in. Clearly that's not the case. Players, especially high volume scorers, can choose which shots they take. It's easy to imagine a player that has missed several shots in a row and is feeling "cold" would concentrate on only taking higher percentage shots. There's also the fact that I'm combining games together. That could potentially lead to players looking less streaky than they are within the course of a single game. But it should also make truly unstreaky players look less &lt;em&gt;unstreaky&lt;/em&gt;. Streaks getting "reset" by the end of the game should make players act more like a purely random process -- not too streaky or unstreaky. It shouldn't increase the standard deviation of the z-scores like we're seeing, or cause a shift towards unstreakiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may do a simulation to illustrate that, but in the meantime, the most controlled shot data we have is free throw data. Every free throw should have exactly the same level of difficulty for the player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the data for the 200,000+ free throws in the NBA regular season over the past four years (October 2021 through April 2025).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the z-scores for all players. There's a big chunk taken out of the middle of the bell curve, but it's normal-ish other than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="free throws" src="/img/free-throws.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;240 players have made over 200 free throws in the past 4 years. When I restrict to just those players, there's a slight skew towards the "hot hand", or being more streaky than expected. There are no exceptionally &lt;em&gt;lukewarm hands&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to free throws. It's sort of the mirror image of what we saw with high volume field goal shooters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="free throws, over 200 makes" src="/img/over-200-ft.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;count    240.000000

max        1.845302
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions, for now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel comfortable concluding that the hot hand doesn't exist when it comes to field goals. I can't say why there's a tendency towards &lt;em&gt;unstreakiness&lt;/em&gt; yet, but I suspect it is due to shot selection. Players who have made a bunch of shots may take more difficult shots than average, and players who have missed a bunch of shots will go for an easier shot than average. While players can't choose when to "heat up" or "go cold", they can certainly change shot selection based on their emotions or the momentum of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a slight tendency towards the &lt;em&gt;hot hand&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to free throws. It's worth investigating further, I think. But the effect there doesn't appear to be nearly as strong as the &lt;em&gt;lukewarm hand&lt;/em&gt; tendency for field goals.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="sports analytics"></category><category term="basketball"></category><category term="the hot hand"></category></entry><entry><title>The Hardest Road</title><link href="/the-hardest-road.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-05-01T10:20:00-10:00</published><updated>2025-05-01T10:20:00-10:00</updated><author><name>casey durfee</name></author><id>tag:None,2025-05-01:/the-hardest-road.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What geology can tell us about Kevin Durant's next team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When NBA superstar Kevin Durant left the Oklahoma City Thunder to join the Golden State Warriors, he said that doing so was taking "the hardest road". This was met with a lot of mockery, because the Golden State Warriors had just won 73 games, the most in NBA history, the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was widely regarded as an uncool move, ring chasing, the ultimate bandwagon riding. It was clearly an absurd thing to say about the level of challenge he chose. It also made the NBA less interesting for several years, so he deserved some hate for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What people missed was that according to geology, he wasn't totally off-base. Streets are paved with asphalt, which is a combination of local rocks (aggregate) and tar. That means that some regions of America have harder roads than others, based on the local geology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="taken from https://www.forconstructionpros.com/equipment/worksite/article/10745911/aggregate-hardness-map-of-the-united-states" src="/img/aggregate-map.jpg"&gt;
(&lt;a href="https://www.forconstructionpros.com/equipment/worksite/article/10745911/aggregate-hardness-map-of-the-united-states"&gt;source: https://www.forconstructionpros.com/equipment/worksite/article/10745911/aggregate-hardness-map-of-the-united-states&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma City is located right in the center of Oklahoma, with some of the softest aggregate in the United States. It's reasonable for someone who cares about road hardness to want to leave. Just about anywhere (except for Florida) would have been an improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "hardest road" out of OKC at that time would've been the one to New Orleans. It's about a 700 mile drive, and it looks like it's a nice gradient from some of the softest roads in the United States to the very hardest ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Orleans Pelicans at the time were &lt;a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NOP/2016.html"&gt;pretty bad&lt;/a&gt;, basically just Anthony Davis, a couple good role players (Ryan Anderson, Jrue Holiday), and a rich collection of "Let's Remember Some Guys" Guys (Jimmer Fredette, Nate Robinson, Luke Babbitt, Ish Smith, Alonzo Gee, Norris Cole). KD and AD on the same team would have been cool, but even with Kevin Durant, the Pelicans would likely have been pretty bad. Certainly worse than the OKC team that Durant wanted to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although technically the "hardest road" out of Oklahoma City, going to New Orleans would have been a poor career choice for KD. The Pelicans have always been a cheap, poorly run team. I can't imagine it being a destination for any free agent of Kevin Durant's caliber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He really should have said "I'm taking the hardest road that doesn't lead to a mismanaged tire fire of a team. Also by "hardest" I mean on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale"&gt;Mohs scale&lt;/a&gt;, not the challenge" and everybody would have understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northern California has a medium-hard substrate, so his choice to go to the Warriors was definitely a harder road than a lot of other places he could have gone. Since leaving the Warriors, he's played for two other teams with medium-hard roads: the Brooklyn Nets and the Phoenix Suns. He's never chosen to take a softer road. Give him credit for that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that there are rumors about Kevin Durant being traded from the Suns, what can geology tell us about Durant's next destination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other NBA cities with medium-hard to hard roads are New Orleans, Boston, Charlotte, Houston, New York, Sacramento, Utah, and Washington DC. He's from DC so that might be nice. But Durant always says he wants to compete for a championship. So we can rule them out, as well as New Orleans, Charlotte and Utah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't really see Boston or New York wanting to tweak their rosters too much, because they're both already good enough to win a championship and don't have a lot of tradeable assets. Sacramento's not a great fit. The Kings would be dreadful on defense, and have too many players who need the ball at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves Houston. Durant would fix the Rockets' biggest weakness -- not having a go-to scorer -- and Houston could surround him with a bunch of guys who can play defense. Most importantly, he'd get to continue to drive on medium-hard roads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Durant to the Houston Rockets. The geology doesn't lie.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="sports analytics"></category><category term="basketball"></category></entry></feed>
