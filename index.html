<p>Notebook: <a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/csdurfee.github.io/blob/main/notebooks/nba-clutch-stats.ipynb">https://github.com/csdurfee/csdurfee.github.io/blob/main/notebooks/nba-clutch-stats.ipynb</a></p>
<p>This week, I'm discussing <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/clutch-traditional?Season=2010-11">team clutch statistics from nba.com</a>.</p>
<p>A basketball player who tends to make good plays in high-pressure situations is known as being "clutch". When the game is on the line, who do you want taking the last shot, or guarding the other team's best player?</p>
<p>Like a lot of other psychological phenomena, I think "clutchness" is mostly something we notice in retrospect. It's easy to remember when our favorite players "came up clutch". It's harder to remember times when they didn't, and impossible to accurately decide whether a player is objectively <em>clutcher</em> than average or not based on our subjective memories, rather than using statistics. </p>
<p>With the <em>hot hand</em> phenomenon, we notice a player "can't miss" after they've already made a few shots in a row, and then they make another one. Although I've shown that the opposite of the hot hand exists in the NBA, I can't argue against the feeling that a player is <em>on fire</em>, or <em>can get hot</em>. I feel it, too. Like <em>clutchness</em>, some players just seem to have it, and some don't. But I think it's mostly an artifact of how we remember things.</p>
<p>This is perhaps reflected in the NBA's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Clutch_Player_of_the_Year">Clutch Player of the Year award</a>. Last year, it was won by Jalen Brunson, who is a player I think NBA fans would consider pretty clutch -- at least on offense.  But <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/clutch-traditional?PerMode=Per100Possessions&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;dir=A&amp;sort=AST">statistically</a>, besides scoring a lot, Brunson wasn't one of the best players in clutch time last season. His team, the Knicks, only went 17-11 (60.7%) in clutch games, which was almost exactly matched their overall record, 50-32 (61%). They won as many games in the clutch as I'd expect them to. But Brunson feels like a <em>clutch guy</em>. It's an award based on <em>vibes</em>, rather than objective facts.</p>
<p>This week, I'm examining team level NBA clutch statistics. The NBA formally defines <em>clutch time</em> as the last 5 minutes of a game, when the score is within 5 points. Obviously some threshold had to be chosen, but I wonder if a species with 4 fingers on each hand would have set the threshold at the last 4 minutes, when the game is within 4 points.</p>
<h2>Our old frenemy, conditional probability</h2>
<p>The math behind statistics isn't that hard, compared to some kinds (lookin' at you, partial differential equations). The real difficulty is the process of thinking statistically. It's easy to find statistical correlations that seem important or profound, but are actually meaningless once the mess of conditional probabilities are untangled, like a box of old Christmas lights, and the right baseline is established.</p>
<p>An example I came across recently involves bets on NFL point totals, where one can wager on whether the total number of points scored by both teams is higher or lower than a certain number. Let's say an NFL game is a blowout -- one team wins by more than 20 points. 55% of the time, when a game is a blowout, the bet on the over wins. Is this an interesting correlation?</p>
<p>We might take the 55% as evidence of the <em>rubber band effect</em>, where teams that are ahead by a large margin tend to play with less intensity on defense, allowing the other team to score <em>garbage time points</em> -- scores that don't affect the outcome of the game, but make the final score look more competitive than the game actually was. It looks like the <em>rubber band effect</em> makes the over point total more likely to win, right?</p>
<p>Nope! There's a hidden conditional. In order for one team to win by at least 20 points, at least one team has to score 20 points first. In the set of games where one team scored at least 20, the over wins 60% of the time. So the game being a blowout lowers the probability of the over winning, when considering those games against their true peers. A 20-0 blowout probably should happen more often than a 40-20 blowout. That makes sense. But so does "teams leading by a lot get lazy on defense, leading to more points than expected". And that's wrong.</p>
<h2>Clutch time is mediocrity time</h2>
<p>Clutch games are pretty common, around half of all NBA contests. That's stayed pretty consistent from year to year, though perhaps the rate is going down over time:</p>
<p><img alt="/img/percent-clutch-time.png" src="/img/percent-clutch-time.png"></p>
<p>Here's a plot of each teams' winning percentage versus percentage of games played in the clutch:</p>
<p><img alt="/img/clutch-density.png" src="/img/clutch-density.png"></p>
<p>In order for an NBA game to have clutch time, it has to be a close game in the first place. Really good teams and really bad teams will be involved in fewer <em>clutch</em> games than teams in the middle, because they're usually either winning or losing by a large margin at the end of the game.</p>
<p>Maybe <em>clutch</em> should be seen as a backhanded complement. Houston is known as "Clutch City" because of the Rockets, which is an odd thing. For starters, I don't know why a rocket would need a clutch, unless it is some sort of steampunk apparatus. Second, the team that earned the "Clutch City" moniker was the 1993 Rockets, who blew multiple big leads in the Finals, and just barely won the championship in 7 games against a team they should've beaten easily. And it's unlikely the Rockets would have beaten the Bulls, if Michael Jordan hadn't been playing baseball that season. Houston only became "Clutch City" due to luck and the team's inability to finish games off. Is it really <em>clutch</em> to dig yourself out of a hole that you created? </p>
<p>There's a similar thing with NFL football. Brett Favre and John Elway are known as clutch quarterbacks because they led a lot of game winning drives. But many times, they were only in the position to have to win the game on the last drive because they threw 3 interceptions earlier in the game.</p>
<h2>Do especially clutch teams exist?</h2>
<p>I think we should start with the assumption that teams' records in clutch situations should be close to their record overall. Here's a plot of win percentage in clutch vs. non-clutch games.</p>
<p><img alt="/img/clutch-non-clutch.png" src="/img/clutch-non-clutch.png"></p>
<p>Teams that are bad lose at similar rates in both clutch and non-clutch games. Teams that are good tend to be good in both. Teams that are bad tend to be bad in both. Most teams are mediocre at both.</p>
<h3>Offense and Defensive Ratings in the clutch</h3>
<p>Offensive and Defensive Ratings are a measure of the average number of points scored/given up by a team per 100 possessions.</p>
<p>There is a clear effect on these numbers in clutch time. Offensive and defensive ratings are both about 2.5 points lower in the final minutes of close games. Either offenses are worse, or defenses are better, or a bit of both. But it's a little bit harder for teams to score.</p>
<p>What would constitute evidence that a team actually has a special ability to win games in the clutch, versus just doing what they always do?</p>
<p>I decided to look at teams that are better on both offense and defense in clutch situations.  These are the teams in the upper left quadrant of this graph:</p>
<p><img alt="/img/clutch-off-def.png" src="/img/clutch-off-def.png"></p>
<p>I restricted to teams that were at least 3 points better on both offense and defense.  51 teams since 2010 have met that threshold. </p>
<p>That set includes some great teams, such as the 2015 Golden State Warriors, who went a record 73-9 in the regular season, and 3 that won the NBA championship (2010 Mavericks, 2012 Miami Heat, and 2014 Warriors).</p>
<p>But the set also includes some truly bad teams, like the 2010 Cleveland Cavaliers, who went 19-63, 2013 Philadelphia 76ers, who also went 19-63, and the 2023 Charlotte Hornets, who went 21-61. 11 of 51 teams on the list didn't even make the playoffs, and 10 of them lost more games than they won.</p>
<p>The 40 <em>clutch</em> teams that made the playoffs won an average of 5.8 playoff games, versus 5.2 for all teams that made the playoffs. So these <em>clutch teams</em> do a little better in the postseason, but it's not a massive bump.</p>
<p>It's possible coaching makes a difference. There are four teams coached by Rick Carlisle on the list (2010, 2014, 2015 Mavericks; 2024 Pacers). Or perhaps certain players are significant. There are also four teams starring James Harden (2013, 2017 and 2019 Rockets; 2023 LA Clippers).</p>
<p>While being <em>clutch</em> is a positive signal, but not as strong as being a good team overall. Among the last 15 NBA champions, they average a rank of 5.3 in clutch win percentage, but 2.6 in overall win percentage on the season. Because it's a smaller sample, performance in clutch games really should be a less accurate predictor of team skill than their overall record, and it is.</p>

<p>Some stats courtesy of <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/">pro-football-reference.com</a></p>
<p>Before the first game of the NFL season, I captured the power rankings from 11 media sources, as well as odds on pre-season win totals from a couple of sportsbooks. I thought it would be interesting to see how the power rankers did.</p>
<h2>2025 was a strange one</h2>
<p>We've <a href="/nobody-wins-at-nfl-betting.html">previously seen</a> that gamblers have done historically badly this NFL season.</p>
<p>The betting markets severely underestimated both teams that made the Super Bowl. The Patriots' preseason over win total was <code>8.5 +105</code>, meaning a slightly less than 50% chance of winning 9 games or more. The Patriots were expected to have the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL, so that was a pretty modest number.</p>
<p>The only team that exceeded their win total by more than the Patriots was the Seattle Seahawks. Their preseason over win total odds were <code>7.5 -139</code>. (The <code>-139</code> odds implies there's a <code>139/239 = 58%</code> chance of the bet winning.)</p>
<p>The Patriots had an average rank of 22nd in the preseason power rankings, with the highest ranking being 17th, and the lowest 27th. The Seahawks had an average rank of 19th, with the highest being 16th and the lowest 27th.</p>
<p>There were a lot of disappointing teams this year. Of the top 7 highest ranked teams at the beginning of the season, only one of them, the Buffalo Bills (#3 average rank) won a playoff game. The Eagles (#1 average rank) and Packers (7th) lost in the first round. The Ravens (2nd), Chiefs (4th), Lions (5th) and Commanders (6th) didn't even make the playoffs.</p>
<p>The teams that the Seahawks and Patriots beat to make the Super Bowl were a lot closer to preseason expectations. The Denver Broncos were ranked 10th on average, and the Los Angeles Rams were ranked 8th. </p>
<p>While the 4 lowest ranked teams (Giants, Titans, Browns and Saints) were all bad, the Colts and Panthers also ranked in the bottom 6 on average, and had very good seasons. The Colts looked like one of the best teams in football for a big chunk of the season, before injuries took hold. The Panthers made the playoffs, and almost won.</p>
<h2>Comparing expert rankings to SRS</h2>
<p>Pro-football-reference.com has a statistic called SRS, which is the average margin of victory, adjusted for strength of schedule. So it should be a better metric for comparing teams than their actual win-loss record, or average margin of victory. Because the NFL schedule is so short, it's important to use an adjusted metric like SRS.</p>
<p>Comparing preseason power rankings to SRS, the teams that defied expectations the most were the Colts, Jaguars, Seahawks, and Patriots (better than expected), and the Commanders and Bengals (worse than expected).</p>
<h2>Who had the most accurate preseason power rankings?</h2>
<p>I calculated the correlation between the power rankers and regular season SRS. USA Today was the most accurate, and Inside the Lines (CBS) was the least accurate. </p>

<p>These correlations are far lower than what we saw with <a href="/two-ways-to-go-from-the-middle.html">NBA power rankings</a> a while back.</p>
<p>The worst power ranker, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/nfl-power-rankings-2025-model-says-packers-in-top-tier-chiefs-not-among-top-five-contenders/">Inside the Lines (CBS)</a>, used a statistical model, but it sounded like baloney, so I wasn't surprised they did poorly.  Here's how they describe their model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we have reverse engineered oddsmakers' models which has resulted in 85-90% of our projections being virtually identical to the oddsmaker's lines (main markets and props). When sportsbooks' lines differ from ours, we know they are likely manipulating a line to either sucker the public or minimize risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their model is so good that when its predictions differ from reality, we should assume reality itself is wrong or somebody's being dishonest! Good grief. Lord grant me the confidence of a bottom tier tout.  </p>
<p>They claim they've gone <code>72-47, 60.5%, +18.5 units over the last three seasons</code> but I couldn't find any record of those picks. If they were taking the games at even odds, they would be up +20.3 units, so they're taking some bets that should win more than 50% of the time, which makes the winning percentage look artificially better. We previously saw <a href="/nobody-wins-at-nfl-betting.html">a tout known as "The Commish" over at FTN</a> doing the same thing.</p>
<h3>Which 2025 NFL records are misleading?</h3>
<p>By point differential, the Patriots were the 3rd best team in the league, but by SRS, they were 6th, behind three teams from the NFC West (Seahawks, Rams and 49ers). </p>
<p>Due to being in the same division as two powerhouse teams, the Cardinals and 49ers had the biggest discrepancies between margin of victory and SRS -- they were probably better than their win-loss record. In the other direction, the Patriots, Broncos, Bills, Cowboys and Dolphins benefitted the most from playing an easy schedule.</p>
<h3>Are the 2025 Seahawks historically great?</h3>
<p>There was no disagreement at the top. The Seahawks and Rams were #1 and #2 in both SRS and margin of victory. That may be underselling how good they were. <a href="https://ftnfantasy.com/nfl/final-2025-dvoa-ratings">According to DVOA</a>, a more sophisticated way of assessing team strength than SRS, both the Rams and Seahawks were among the top 10 teams in NFL history. </p>
<p>That's pretty remarkable to me. My instinct is that DVOA isn't adjusting to changes in the football rules or strategy over time, because it's hard to believe that a team quarterbacked by Sam Darnold is one of the 10 greatest of all time. But what do I know? I'm a guy who gets most of his football news from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ll2uwZMaA&amp;list=PLpfKWYL55S9Eckl2J5py0ujqjyarU5gRP">Tom Grossi's "If the NFL was scripted" videos</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure anybody knows anything about football, though. The Seahawks' average preseason rank was 19th. Is it possible a team that 11 football experts thought would be below average was actually historically great? Football is way less knowable than other sports because of the short season, the large number of players, and the outsized influence of the quarterback. </p>
<p>Even with that in mind, these power rankings have not aged well. 6 out of 11 rankers (CBS Sports, USA Today, DirecTV, NFL Spin Zone, TeamRankings.com, Sharp Football Analysis) put the Arizona Cardinals ahead of the Seahawks at the beginning of the season. The Cardinals finished with a 3-14 record, the worst in the league, while the Seahawks went 14-3, the best in the league. It's hard to be wronger than that.</p>
<p>The Seahawks defense may have been historically great this season, but none of the power rankers seemed to have a clue that would happen. Considering the Seahawks went 10-7 and had the 11th best defense the prior season, the low rankings are puzzling.</p>
<p>Here's everything <a href="https://nflspinzone.com/nfl-power-rankings-risers-and-fallers-after-week-1-preseason-action-in-2025/2">NFL Spin Zone</a> had to say about the Seahawks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seattle might have something special on their hands with Jalen Milroe, but he is definitely a raw prospect and will absolutely need some time to turn into an NFL-caliber passer. Sam Darnold could be competent in the meantime, though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/nate-davis/2025/07/30/nfl-power-rankings-2025-preseason-eagles-ravens-chiefs/85429548007/">USA Today</a> didn't remark on the defense, either: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seattle Seahawks (15): As a member of the Vikings, QB Sam Darnold dealt the 2024 Seahawks a death blow last December in Lumen Field. Now the 12s can only hope he's the real deal and won't serve a self-inflicted coup de grâce in November.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-power-rankings-preseason-eagles-49ers-cowboys-jets-jaguars/092235fe2a7fd870c0c95c61">The Sporting News</a> at least mentioned it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seattle Seahawks (18): The Seahawks are feeling overall about their offensive state in Year 2 with the changes to Sam Darnold and Klint Kubiak but to compete for a playoff spot in the NFC West, Mike Macdonald's defense needs more impactful results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Cardinals played in the hardest division in the NFL and their quarterback got injured after five games, so some of their futility is understandable. But after seeing the season play out, it's hard to imagine any possible scenario where the Cardinals were going to be better than the Seahawks, even if a majority of football experts thought so before the season. </p>
<p>Hindsight bias is a heck of a thing. It seems obvious in retrospect that the Chiefs (the consensus 4th best team before the season) have been losing steam for a while and didn't do enough to keep up with Father Time. Of course the Bengals (11th) were going to be terrible on defense, and the Panthers (27th) were significantly more talented and better coached than the Jets (26th) or Raiders (25th).</p>
<p>These all would've been hot takes just a few months ago, though. It's not like there was a lot of disagreement on the preseason rankings. Most of the power rankers had a correlation of .9 or higher with each other. The conventional wisdom, or whatever these handicappers are using, was just way off this year. Everybody's bad at this.</p>
<h3>Another bad football handicapper</h3>
<p>TeamRankings.com had the 2nd most accurate power rankings. They also sell picks against the spread. We've previously looked at a bunch of football touts, and they've all lost money this season. TeamRankings is the first exception to that, though just barely. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/betting-models/detailed-splits/">They went 149-130 on their "TR Picks" this season</a>, for a 53.4% winning percentage and +5.5 units of profit. However, they've gone 493-479 (50.7% win percentage, -30.8 units) over their past 1,000 picks. So, like the average entrants in the Super Contest, they're a little better than flipping a coin, but not good enough to beat the vig.</p>
<p>They also offer algorithmic picks based on their power rankings, which are notably bad. Those went 126-153 (45.2% win percentage) this season, and 454-518 (46.7% win percentage) over the last 1000 bets. Fading those picks would've made +14.4 units this season. </p>
<p>Their power rankings were relatively good, but that doesn't mean they're useful for deciding which side of the line has more value. It's not enough to know which team is better than the other one -- anybody who follows the NFL could probably tell you that. A gambler has to accurately estimate how much better in order to identify positive EV bets.</p>
<p>TeamRankings charges $299 a year for a subscription.</p>
<h3>nflpickwatch: A smorgasboard of bad football handicappers</h3>
<p>I came across another site that sells picks in the course of writing this.</p>
<p><a href="https://nflpickwatch.com/nfl/picks/ats/experts/2025/22?s_sB=season_profit_loss&amp;s_sD=true&amp;d_s_pi_e=true&amp;d_s_pi_o_u=Over&amp;d_s_pi_p=50&amp;t_t_r=20&amp;h_h_r=2024">nflpickwatch.com</a> is yet another website that sells NFL football picks, aggregated from experts across the internet, including writers for ESPN, the New York Post, and Bleacher Report.</p>
<p>They have 181 NFL experts on the site this year. Of those 181 experts, 84% of them lost money this season. If the experts made their picks randomly, we'd expect around 22% of them to be making money, so 16% is bad. 99 of the 181 experts (55%) had below 50% winning percentage. Once again, people who get paid to talk football for a living are significantly worse than a coin flip.</p>
<p>The site also has a section for fans to make their picks. 551 out of 2,682 (20.5%) fans made money this year. That's still worse than we'd get from flipping a coin, but better than the experts.</p>
<p>The experts have done better at times in the past. Here are the percentage of experts that made money (won over 52.4% of their bets) by year:</p>

<p>The touts were better than the 22% rate we'd expect from flipping coins in 4 of the last 8 seasons, and worse in the other 4. Combining all 8 seasons together, 323/1340 tout-years were profitable, a 24% rate.</p>
<p>So in aggregate, they may be a tiny better than flipping coins, but even in the very best season, the majority of touts on the site would lose you money if you took their picks.</p>
<p>At least they're a little cheaper than TeamRankings -- only $180 a year for the chance to lose money playing somebody else's picks.</p>
<p>Who's paying for this stuff, and how do I get a taste? It's easier to get people to pay for bad advice than it is to get them to follow good advice given freely. If you tell people you can see the future, they will pay for your predictions even if they're worse than random, but if you show them evidence that nobody can see the future, they'll refuse to believe you, if they even bother to listen in the first place.</p>
<h2>The Mathletix Bajillion, final edition</h2>
<p>I forgot to do picks last week, so I guess that's the end of the experiment. Both teams went 2-2 the prior week, meaning the Hand-Eggs finished with a record of 27-26-1, and the McAul-Stars finished at 26-24-4. The Hand-Eggs lost a tiny bit of (fake) money on the season and the McAul-Stars made a tiny bit. At <em>full juice</em>, both teams would've lost money despite having winning records. </p>
<p>I was going to reveal which team was picking bets by chance, and which was using a simple algorithm, but since they ended up getting very similar results, I guess it doesn't matter which is which, right?</p>
<p>Although it was a small sample size, I think I showed that betting <em>reduced juice</em> can save a substantial amount of money. I don't think it's reasonable to expect to make money betting on the NFL, but betting reduced juice is at least <em>less irrational</em> than using a retail sportsbook like DraftKings that <a href="https://draftkings.gcs-web.com/static-files/63f5b560-fcf4-4117-9d2c-1cfe2400798a">spends over $100 Million a month on advertising</a>.</p>
<p>The Ringer have been slightly more respectable the past few weeks, and they now have 2 of 5 teams with winning records (but still losing money against the vig). Collectively, the Ringer have a 242-273 record, for a 47% winning percentage. The three gambling podcasts had the three worst records, with one going 47-56 (-14.6 units), and the other two at 45-58 (-18.8 units apiece).</p>

<p>This week, more insights into NFL betting from BetMGM gambling data (harvested from Yahoo). I'm looking at the last 5 seasons of regular season NFL games (2021-2022 thru 2025-2026). There are 1,359 games total, around 140 of which are missing betting percentage data, so have been excluded from parts of this analysis.</p>
<h1>Point totals</h1>
<p>Gamblers can wager on whether the total number of points scored in an NFL game will be over or under a certain number. These bets are sometimes called <em>over/unders</em>. </p>
<p>Spreads are a wager on the difference in team scores, and point totals are a wager on the sum. It's kind of an odd bet, because it doesn't matter which team wins. All bets are math problems, but over/unders are more obviously so. </p>
<p>The over has won 48.4% of the time (658/1359 games). Point totals almost never push (hit the number exactly, meaning neither side wins). That's only happened in 12 of 1358 games. About 60% of point totals are on the half point (6.5 instead of 6, for example), so they can't push.</p>
<p>The win rate for overs has changed over the past 5 seasons. The over won about 46% of the time from 2021-23, and 53% of the time from 2024-25. That possibly mirrors what we saw <a href="/nfl-spread-betting-statistics-more-folly-of-crowds.html">last time</a> -- it was wildly profitable to <em>fade the public</em> on spread bets from 2021-23, and wasn't the last two seasons. I don't have a good theory as to why the win percents mirror each other.</p>
<p><img alt="/img/fade-spread-total.png" src="/img/fade-spread-total.png"></p>
<p>Taking the under is usually equivalent to fading the public, because <a href="/overs-money-lines-and-pigeonholes.html">as with the NBA</a>, the betting public greatly prefers the over on point totals, taking them 86.8% (1056/1217) of the time. When the public takes the over, they win 48.1% of the time. On the rare occasions where they take the under, they win 46.6% of the time. So, this is yet another example of where gamblers as a whole do worse than a coin flip. In 3 of the 5 seasons, they did poorly enough that <em>fading</em> their picks would have been profitable.</p>
<p>Half of all point total spreads are between 41.5 and 47.5, with the median being 44.5. A naive betting strategy would be to assume that low point totals are too low (always take the over if the total is less than 44.5), and high point totals are too high (take the under if the total is greater than or equal to 44.5). This strategy would've gone 700-658 (51.6%). It's not much, but there might be a slight advantage to betting on <em>boring</em> point total outcomes.</p>
<p>Here are the win rates for betting on the over, by point total range (split by quartiles):</p>

<p>Some of the variation is just noise, but based on this breakdown, taking overs on high point totals seems like a bad move.</p>
<p>Here are what the actual point totals look like: </p>
<p><img alt="/img/nfl-point-totals.png" src="/img/nfl-point-totals.png"></p>
<h2>Point total errors</h2>
<p>Here are what the errors against the point total look like. Positive values are games that went over the total, negative are games that went under.</p>
<p><img alt="/img/nfl-over-under.png" src="/img/nfl-over-under.png"></p>
<p>The median error is -0.5, so the errors are fairly balanced even if the graph isn't symmetrical.  As with other NFL data, there are spikes because some point totals are more likely than others.</p>
<p>There's a longer tail to the positive side than the negative -- it's impossible to score fewer than 0 points, which limits how far under a bet can go, but there's theoretically no limit to how many points the teams can score in the over direction. </p>
<p>Here's how the total errors break down.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>count    1358.000000

<h1>NFL money lines and the favorite-longshot bias</h1>
<p>A money line bet is the simplest type of bet to understand, because it's a wager on who will win the game outright. A bet on the underdog will pay out more than you have to risk, because it's less likely to happen.</p>
<p>Money line data is always going to be high variance -- one +400 bet winning or not can wildly change the Expected Value. That was a problem with the NBA, which has 5x the games of the NFL, so it's definitely going to be a problem here.</p>
<p>The public's money line picks do better than their spread picks. They're making an average of -3.1% on money line bets, which is a step up from the -6.7% they're doing on the spread. That mirrors the NBA, where the public does significantly better on the money line than spread bets.</p>
<p>The public is also a slightly better Expected Value than taking money line bets randomly. The public are saved by their love of favorites, which they took in 96% (1181/1228) of games, and are a relatively good deal on the money line.</p>
<p>Each bet has two sides. Underdog money lines on NFL football are a bad bet in general (-7.3% EV), but huge underdogs are especially bad (-29.7% EV). This is evidence of the <a href="/lessons-from-four-years-of-betmgm-nba-gambling-stats.html">favorite-longshot bias</a> in NFL betting. A -30% EV puts longshot underdog money lines in the same league as the biggest sucker bets you can take -- Same Game Parlays, <a href="/cool-parlay-bro.html">4+ leg parlays</a>, and teasers.</p>
<p>"EV %" is the expected value of taking every bet in each category. Overall, money line bets have a -5.5% EV.</p>

<p>That -29.67% for huge dogs is hiding a big discrepancy. Huge home dogs <code>(&gt;= +400)</code> have actually made money, winning 8/31 games. Huge away dogs have only won 6/92 games, for an absurd -63% Expected Value. The average odds for these bets is +600 (1 in 7 chance of winning), so we'd expect 13 of 92 bets to win, not 6.</p>
<p>Like I said at the top, money line dogs are going to be extremely variable, and the +400 number is a totally arbitrary cutoff. But even if huge away dogs had won twice as often, they'd still be unprofitable. Woof!</p>
<p>Money line favorites turn out to be a slightly better value than spread bets. But the estimated EVs are very sensitive to changes. I've been working on this project for a couple of weeks now, and noticed the numbers changing pretty significantly over the last 2 weeks of the NFL season. So the estimates are not telling the whole story about the range of possible outcomes.</p>
<h3>Bootstrapping money lines</h3>
<p>Since every bet has a different payout, they're not going to follow some nice, polite distribution. In order to estimate the variance in outcomes, I'm going to use bootstrapping, <a href="/one-in-e.html">a popular technique in these parts</a>. </p>
<p>I'm using the <a href="https://scikits-bootstrap.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">scikits-bootstrap</a> library to generate a 90% confidence interval for the Expected Values. It samples random subsets of the bets in each category and calculates the EV of each subset. Then it returns the 5th and 95th percentile outcomes, which is a plausible range of values for the EV.</p>

<p>Those are some pretty wide confidence intervals. Even the big categories like <code>all favorites</code> lead to a wide range of outcomes.</p>
<p>Even with the -29.7% EV for huge dogs, we can't rule out some small hope that somebody could make money taking them, I suppose. But as always, if there's randomness involved, we don't get to pick whether we get the 5th percentile result, the average result, or the 95th percentile result.</p>

<p>This time, I'm looking at NFL gambling statistics from the last five seasons. The data is from BetMGM, scraped from Yahoo's website (<a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/cleveland-browns-carolina-panthers-20220911029/?section=odds">example page</a>) via an internal API (<a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/site/api/resource/sports.graphite.gameOdds;dataType=graphite;endpoint=graphite;gameIds=nfl.g.20221002021">example request</a>).</p>
<p>My previous analysis of NBA betting data from the same source is <a href="/lessons-from-four-years-of-betmgm-nba-gambling-stats.html">available here</a>. Code is available at <a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/scrape_yahoo_odds/">https://github.com/csdurfee/scrape_yahoo_odds/</a>.</p>
<p>There's not as much NFL data as I'd like, or any data nerd would. We only have 1,360 games worth of data spread over the five years since gambling was legalized. Around 140 of those games are missing data about betting percentages, so have been excluded from most of the analysis. I'm only looking at regular season games.</p>
<p>As usual, I'm presenting this data because I think it's an interesting window into how people and markets behave around sports. There's no reason to believe the trends I highlight here will continue in the future. <em>It's not eternal, imperishable</em>. Which is to say: I don't think you should bet on the information given here, or at all.</p>

<p>When I looked at the NBA, I found that a bet on the <em>public side</em>, the side that gets more money bet on it, wins 49.2% of the time against the spread. So there's a slight bias against the <em>public</em>, but not enough that somebody could make money betting the opposite way.</p>
<p>I was expecting something similar for the NFL. I believed that NFL lines were probably quite fair, meaning no matter how you slice the data -- home vs. away team, favorite vs. underdog, popular vs. unpopular side -- a gambler will end up losing over the long run no matter which side they take.</p>
<p>Turns out, that's not true. </p>
<h1>Spreads: the popular side gets crushed</h1>
<p>The side with a higher wager percentage (by number of bets placed) has gone 605-755 over the past 5 years. That's a winning percentage of 44.5%.  Someone taking the unpopular side (<em>fading the public</em>) on every NFL game would've won 55.5% of their bets, for a profit of 89.5 units at standard -110 odds. That's an Expected Value of +6.6% on each bet. </p>
<p>Here are the winning percentages for <em>fading the public</em> by year:</p>
<p><img alt="/img/nfl-fade.png" src="/img/nfl-fade.png"></p>
<p>The yellow lines are a 90% confidence interval, assuming that <em>fading the public</em> should only win 50% of the time. 2021-2023 are outside the range we'd expect due to chance, but 2024 and 2025 have been in range, so whatever trend may have been causing the imbalance could already be gone. For instance, gamblers may have gotten more savvy over time, or the lines less imbalanced because of more market competition.</p>
<p>The green dotted line is at 52.4%, the minimum win rate to break even at -110 odds. The average entrant in the <a href="/nobody-wins-at-nfl-betting.html">Super Contest</a> has never exceeded that in 13 seasons, while <em>fading the public</em> has done so in 4 out of 5 seasons.</p>
<p>There are a fair number of games where the stake percentage (amount of money) and the wager percentage (number of bets) disagree about which side is the <em>public</em> side.  Excluding those games leads to even more impressive results -- a 649-500 record against the spread for the unpopular side. That bumps the win percentage up to 56.5%, and +99 units at -110 odds, or +124 units at <em>reduced juice</em>. That's an expected value of +8.6% on each bet.</p>
<p>We should expect pretty much any binary slice of the data to win between 47 and 53% of the time, assuming the imbalance is due to chance. For example, the home team went 650-710 (47.8%) against the spread. The underdog went 681-679 (50.1%). Home underdogs went 260-275 (48.6%).</p>
<p>Of course, this is hindsight bias. Imagine if, 5 years ago, someone had proposed to always fade the public on the NFL. I would have thought it was a bad idea. Wouldn't you?</p>
<h2>Other spread trends</h2>
<p>The <em>public</em> tends to favor the away team, taking it in 724/1340 games (59% of the time).</p>
<p>They also generally take the favorite on the spread. They took the favorite in 877/1340 games (64.5% of the time). </p>
<p>Both of those trends were true for NBA basketball as well. Gamblers seem to love their away favorites. When there's an away favorite, they take it 78% of the time (415/535 games). When there's an away underdog, they take it 54% of the time (448/824 games).</p>
<h2>Chunky spreads</h2>
<p>Some final scores in football are more likely than others. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qxr3_b8qkCw">Scorigami</a>, yadda yadda.</p>
<p>That means point differentials are going to have differing degrees of likelihood. A final score difference of 3 is going to be more likely than 5, because scoring a field goal to win a tie game is more likely than the long sequence of actions that would lead to a 5 point differential. (For example, one team might be up by 8 and the other team scores a field goal.)</p>
<p>The spreads are an estimate of the mean outcome of every game, not a guess at the final outcome. So they'll be less widely dispersed, but they should have roughly the same shape. For more detail, see the section "What would perfect lines even look like?" <a href="/last-fair-deal-in-the-country.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here are NBA point spreads. Except for a bit of weirdness in the center due to NBA not having ties, and winning/losing by one point being rare for basketball reasons, it's a nice smooth curve:</p>
<p><img alt="/img/home-spread-frequencies.png" src="/img/home-spread-frequencies.png"></p>
<p>Here's what spreads for the NFL look like. The lack of data isn't helping, but the overall shape clearly isn't a nice smooth curve. The spikes are much higher for certain numbers.</p>
<p><img alt="/img/nfl-home-spread.png" src="/img/nfl-home-spread.png"></p>
<p>Here are the most common home spreads. These represent 73% of all NFL spreads.</p>

<p>NFL betting is a game of 3's. 36% of lines are around +3 or -3. It's unusual to see lines that are greater than 7 or less than -7.5.</p>
<h3>Actual point differentials</h3>
<p>What about the differentials of actual games? I had to pull scores from another datasource, since the yahoo API only provides gambling data. I'm using the score data from <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2025/games.htm">pro-football-reference.com</a>.</p>
<p>Here are spreads and final score differentials laid on top of each other. The orange part is where they overlap. The score differentials are much more dispersed, but they both show similar spikes at certain numbers:</p>
<p><img alt="/img/nfl-spread-score.png" src="/img/nfl-spread-score.png"></p>
<p>The spikes at the 3's and 7's are a bit more legible if I zoom in:</p>
<p><img alt="/img/nfl-spread-score-zoom.png" src="/img/nfl-spread-score-zoom.png"></p>
<p>Here are the most common final score differentials for the away team -- which would be the <em>seemingly ideal</em> point spreads for the home team.</p>

<p>Lots of the games end on 3's, 7's and 6's, just like the lines. Unlike the lines, none of them land on the half point.</p>
<p>The average outcome in the NFL is the home team winning by 2 points, so that's a decent estimate of home field advantage.</p>
<p>About half of all NFL games are within 8 points (a touchdown and a 2 point conversion) of the average outcome.</p>

<h3>What do errors against the spread look like?</h3>
<p>Let's compare the final point differential to the spread. The spread should be an unbiased estimate of the mean outcome between the two teams. We only get one data point to judge the quality of the line's estimate of the mean, which is sort of unfair, but that's just how it works with sports betting. I'll refer to the difference between the point differential and the spread as the error. </p>
<p>As I talked about in <a href="/last-fair-deal-in-the-country.html">"Last fair deal in the country"</a>, because the line makers aren't trying to predict the actual outcome, merely the average outcome, some large errors are inevitable. The line makers can't actually predict the future, and aren't really trying to.</p>
<p>For example, the Miami Dolphins once beat the Broncos 70 to 20. The spread on the game was Dolphins -6, meaning it was off by 44 points relative to the final score. That doesn't mean the line really should have been Dolphins -50, though. It's hard to believe that if the game were played over and over again, the Dolphins would win by an average of 50 points, which is what a 50 point line signifies.</p>
<p>So we need to look at the errors as a whole rather than individual games to decide whether the line makers are good at their jobs or not. If the spreads are fair, the average error should be zero, and the errors should be fairly symmetrically distributed -- there should be about as many games where the error is -7 as it is +7, for instance.</p>
<p>Here's what the errors look like. The median is exactly zero, so kudos to the sportsbooks for that one. The right side is where the home team outperformed the spread, and the left is where they underperformed. There are a few more blowouts against the spread (more than 20 points) for the home team than the away team, but otherwise it's reasonably symmetrical.</p>

<p>Next week: much more on NFL betting.</p>
<h1>Mathletix Bajillion, playoffs round one edition</h1>
<p>Both teams had wicked regressions to the mean this week. </p>
<p>I'll finish the season out, but I'm tempted to quit, because I think I've proved my point about line shopping: both teams are essentially earning a free bet every 30 or so bets by using betting exchanges rather than retail sportsbooks.</p>
<p>Both teams ended up making similar picks, because there are only 6 games to choose from.</p>

<p>Nothing this week, as I'm working on a couple big things about the NFL.</p>
<h1>Mathletix Bajillion, see you next year edition</h1>
<p>One mathletix team picks bets randomly, the other algorithmically.</p>
<p>Both teams took Washington +7, which ended up being a push. The line closed at +9, so they both missed out on a win by taking the bet early in the week. The Mcaul-Stars also lost the bet on JAX -6.5, who won by 6 points. The closing line was JAX -4. So they could've been 3-2 on the week, instead of 1-3-1.</p>
<p>Both games are good examples of the fact that closing lines aren't necessarily more accurate than the opening lines, <a href="/last-fair-deal-in-the-country.html">something I've covered before</a>. Of course, bettors taking the opposite side of Washington and Jacksonville would've been better off taking the lines early in the week. Whether line moves hurt or help will depend on which side of the line the gambler is on.</p>

<h1>Even the experts can't do it</h1>
<p>As I've been chronicling in the <a href="/tag/bajillion.html">"Bajillion"</a> segment, experts are really bad at betting on NFL football, or at least the ones at the Ringer are.</p>
<p>That inspired me to make my first YouTube video, about sports gambling and why it's not really a game of skill. I'm still working on it, but I promised I'd do a thing a week on here. This is that thing.</p>
<p>The Ringer's football/gambling experts doing worse than a coin flip on the NFL could just be coincidence, bad luck, or as gamblers say, a <em>bad beat</em>. I figured I should make more of an effort to find real-world betting records on the NFL by people who have might skill as gamblers, rather than people who talk about sports for a living.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.westgateresorts.com/hotels/nevada/las-vegas/westgate-las-vegas-resort-casino/casino/2025-supercontest-standings/">The Westgate Resorts (TM) Las Vegas Super Contest (R)</a> seemed like the perfect testing ground. It's exactly like the Ringer 107, except there's cash on the line. With a buy-in of $1500 and around 1,000 teams a year, that's a pretty nice top prize. (There are fewer contestants this year than normal, maybe because the buy-in increased from $1,000.)</p>
<p>While the people at the Ringer are using their picks to generate interesting football content, these contestants have lot of financial incentive to do well and nobody they have to explain their picks to. The Ringer writers might have a bias against taking the uglier/harder to justify side of a bet, because their job is really to tell a story that people want to listen to. But these folks should be eating W's like crab legs and not caring how messy it looks.</p>
<p>That $1500 buy in is 207 hours of wages, pre-tax, for someone making the federal minimum wage. For regular folks, $1500 is most of a mortgage payment, or a few months of groceries. Anyone risking that much money should have rational reasons to believe they're good at betting on football, right?</p>
<p>This isn't a non-gambling football writer forced to make picks for the sake of content. The contestants consider themselves sharp enough to beat 1,000 other competitors in a pretty famous betting contest, for a Million dollar payout and the chance to get their photo taken with a bunch of showgirls while holding a giant novelty check. </p>
<p>This is the <em>kumite</em> of football betting, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNZ1ElwD_JA">the ultimate contest of warriors</a>, and I assume you're only going to enter the <em>kumite</em> if you've won a few fights before.  </p>
<p>Mind you, there are around 15 NFL games every week and the teams only have to pick 5 of them for the Super Contest. Maybe most lines are so fair nobody can make money betting them, but the contestants only need to take one game in three. If there are any lines that are beatable, these contestants should be finding them. Their win rate should be an overly optimistic estimate of how beatable the <em>average</em> NFL line is, because they're not taking every game, or random games.</p>
<p>My assumption before running the numbers was that this was a contest for people who should have a decent chance of at least breaking even (over 52.4% winning percentage.)</p>
<h2>The terrible, horrible, no good, very bad year</h2>
<p>That assumption hasn't been even close to true this season. Data as of week 16 taken from <a href="https://www.westgateresorts.com/hotels/nevada/las-vegas/westgate-las-vegas-resort-casino/casino/2025-supercontest-standings/">the Westgate Resorts website</a>.</p>
<p>There are 751 entrants in the 2025 contest. 59% of them (444/751) have a losing record. 76% of them would be losing money, if they were taking their picks at -110 odds.</p>
<p>Collectively, the teams have won 48.6% of their bets. It might not sound terrible, but there are 700+ teams who have taken 70 bets apiece, so it's a big sample size overall -- over 54,000 bets in total. Statistically, they're much worse than flipping a coin. If you flipped a coin 54,000 times and it came up heads 48.6% of the time, you'd be safe concluding it wasn't actually a fair coin.</p>
<p>Here's one way to visualize the suckitude. I simulated each team making picks by flipping a fair coin, and compared them to the actual results.</p>
<p><img alt="/img/super-contest.png" src="/img/super-contest.png"></p>
<p>The white areas are where there were fewer real competitors than we'd expect by random chance, the dark blue parts are where there are more real competitors than expected, and the light blue is the overlap. </p>
<p>The white vertical line is the minimum winning percent to break even at standard -110 odds. Most of the white area, where there are fewer competitors than expected, is to the right of the line, and all of the dark blue area is at less than 50% winning percentage.</p>
<h2>Anti Skill and Uncle Juice</h2>
<p>The best entry in the contest is sitting at 53-21, the amusingly named <code>BIFFS ALMANAC</code>. That record would be an outlier if we were selecting bets by chance, so even though it's a small sample size, kudos to them, and their mostly accurate sports almanac.</p>
<p>The worst record belongs to the also amusingly named <code>THISSHOULDBEEASY</code>, with a record of 24-49. If that team had just taken the opposite of their bets, they'd be in 2nd place!</p>
<p>Most of the teams would be doing better if they wrote down their best picks, then took the opposite of them. Knowing stuff sure seems to be a disadvantage when betting on football. </p>
<p>In aggregate, whatever strategies or football knowledge or divination rites (*) the contestants are using makes them worse at picking winners -- they possibly have <em>anti-skill</em>. This is sort of what the efficient market hypothesis predicts -- picking stocks randomly (or index funds, which invest in every stock on the market) will generally outperform mutual funds that have professional fund managers making the picks.</p>

<h2>Previous years</h2>
<p>After a bunch of wasted work to screen-scrape results from previous years off 3rd party sites, I discovered <a href="https://fantasysupercontest.com/supercontest-standings-2020-week-18">another website</a> that has the complete records going back to 2013 in CSV format. Score!</p>
<p>This season has been particularly difficult on Super Contest gamblers, which probably explains the Ringer's poor record. Previous seasons have looked more like what I expected -- the average Super Contest entrant is a little better than flipping a coin, but not good enough to actually make money gambling. </p>
<p>Here are the Expected Values by year:</p>
<p><img alt="/img/return-rate.png" src="/img/return-rate.png"></p>
<p>The dotted line is at -4.5%, the Expected Value (EV) of taking a bet at -110 with a 50% chance of winning. There have been 5 seasons where the average competitor has done about the same as flipping a coin, or worse, and 2 seasons where they came close to breaking even.</p>
<p>Over all seasons and all contestants, the average EV is -2.5%, about the same as betting 'reduced juice' (-105 odds instead of -110) with a 50% chance of winning. Overall, the EV has been better than what we'd expect by chance, but not good enough to be profitable. </p>
<p>Since the contestants only have to pick 5 games every week, this data should represent the best case scenario -- the most beatable lines possible, being taken by more experienced than average gamblers -- and they're still losing money 11/13 years, and breaking even the other two.</p>
<p>While the 75th percentile has a decent rate of return (up until this season), that's true of flipping a coin as well. With fewer than 100 bets in a Super Contest season, it's very possible to have a winning record by chance alone.</p>
<p>The win rate of competitors has been going down for 3 years in a row. It may be due to weaker competition in the Super Contest, or just random variation, but I would guess it's at least partially due to better lines. More money than ever is being gambled, and there's more information than ever, so the lines should get tighter. I would have to pull a lot more data to answer that question, though.</p>
<h2>Looking for other experts</h2>
<p>OK, maybe that's still not enough proof -- what about people who make a living selling their supposed gambling expertise? I've looked at a ton of sites that sell picks for money, so I have an idea how this will go. But I came across a new one that's run by some pretty smart folks, so let's give it a crack, and I'll try to act suprised at the results.</p>
<p>The site in question is called <a href="https://ftnfantasy.com/bets/nfl/bet-tracker">FTN Fantasy</a>. It's affiliated with Aaron Schatz, who I'm pretty sure basically invented modern football analytics with his site Football Outsiders.</p>
<p><em>DVOA, ever heard of it?</em></p>
<p>If football betting is a game of skill, a game of <em>ball-knowing</em> (at least the stats version of ball-knowing), he should have that skill. Here's Aaron's record:</p>
<p><img alt="/img/just-aaron.png" src="/img/just-aaron.png"></p>
<p>Oh no! He's got a losing record overall, a -11% EV on his bets (vs. -4.5% for picking which mascot would win in a fight). Who could have seen that coming?</p>
<p>Here's the whole site's record:</p>
<p><img alt="/img/ftn-fantasy.png" src="/img/ftn-fantasy.png"></p>
<p>While they have a winning record overall, they have a losing record against the spread (the bets labeled <code>Sides</code>). </p>
<h3>Giving them props</h3>
<p>Prop bets are, well, propping their record up. Since the site is primarily about fantasy football, it makes sense they would be strong on prop bets, since fantasy is all about individual player predictions. That makes them a cut above most tout sites, who aren't good at anything.</p>
<p>It's quite possible that prop bets are beatable in a way spread bets aren't, though as discussed in the video, the big sportsbooks no longer allow taking the unders on prop bets, which I'm sure makes it harder to find value. </p>
<p>My caveat about tips on prop bets is that the lines tend to move very rapidly, and in large amounts. A line could very quickly go from positive to negative Expected Value before someone could get a bet down. So the tips might be legit, but not be <em>usable</em> to the gambler paying for them -- they have a very short shelf life. </p>
<h3>Touts and their tricks</h3>
<p>The only tout with a good record against the spread is esteemed actor Michael Chiklis apparently doing a little moonlighting:</p>
<p><img alt="/img/the-commish.png" src="/img/the-commish.png"></p>
<p>The Commish is doing something I've seen a lot of touts do, which is taking some games at higher than -110 odds in order to make the win-loss record appear better (for example, buying a couple of points and taking -150 odds, which should win significantly more than 50% of the time). The equivalent record at -110 odds would be 41-35, only a 54% winning percentage. That's better than nothin', but it ain't much.</p>
<p>I'm inclined to be distrustful of any tout pulling that trick, since buying points is a negative Expected Value play. (We don't need math for this one: the sportsbooks wouldn't offer the option of buying points if it was positive EV for the gambler. They're counting on the gambler making an emotional decision to buy the points, because they've done the math and know it's a bad deal.) Buying points might make the record look better, but it will hurt profits/increase losses over the long run.</p>

<h2>Two Georges, damn</h2>
<p>In the NBA right now, there are two up-and-coming players with very similar names. This seems to keep happening in the league. I wish somebody would do something about it. </p>
<p>For a few years now, we've had to deal with two players named Jaylin Williams and Jalen Williams who play on the same team and have similarly generic nicknames, forcing hoops fans to remember which one is "J Dub" and which is "Jay Will". This is on top of a dozen other "Jalens" playing for other teams as well. (Do Jalen Rose or his parents get any residuals for all these basketball Jalenses? I hope so.)</p>
<p>Compounding the problem for Keyonte George of the Utah Jazz and Kyshawn George of the Washington Wizards is the fact they play for two of the worst teams in the league. There's only so much Jazz/Wizards basketball anyone can watch and stay sane, so even avid hoops fans should be forgiven for doing a "Christian Bale"/"Kirsten Bell" thing with them. Even pro sports journalists do that.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POcuiqRTbnM" target="_blank"><img alt="&quot;Kristianne Baille&quot; by Trevor Clarence on Youtube" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/POcuiqRTbnM/0.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Both started out looking like they were drowning in the NBA, but they're putting it together, Kyshawn in his second season, Keyonte in his third, so it's time to tune in while you can still say you knew about them before it was cool.</p>
<h3>Kyshawn</h3>
<p>Kyshawn George is a floofy haired youth who always looks like he's 15 minutes late to his Political Science class. He should probably be playing in a North Face puffy jacket and pajama pants instead of a Wizards uniform.</p>
<p><img alt="/img/kyshawn.jpg" src="/img/kyshawn.jpg">
All-Pro Reels, CC BY-SA 4.0 <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</p>
<p>With the big hair and the throwback Wizards jersey, he looks a little bit like greatest player in Washington Bullets/Wizards history, Wes Unseld:</p>
<p><img alt="/img/wes-unseld.jpg" src="/img/wes-unseld.jpg"></p>
<p>His game is a little Unseld-y, too. Unseld was a 6'7" guy who played center. Guarding much bigger players takes a certain quality -- solidness -- that not all players have. Some guys just occupy space better than others. </p>
<p>Although he plays small forward, Kyshawn George has that solidness. At his best, Kyshawn just kind of owns the floor, unafraid to bounce off of other players (or go through them) in order to score or get the rebound. And like Unseld, he has good passing skills. If Wes Unseld played today, he might be a point forward like Kyshawn, who is leading the Wizards in assists.</p>
<p>At his worst, well, Kyshawn's got a lot to learn. I think he has the capability to be a very good defender, but the Wizards are just awful at defense -- worst in the league by points allowed. It's hard for me to tell how good a player is when they're surrounded by teammates who make lots of defensive mistakes.</p>
<h3>Keyonte</h3>
<p>Keyonte George, looks a bit like, I dunno, Timon from the Lion King. I don't have Timon's scouting report, but Keyonte's a super quick modern point guard who can score as well as set his teammates up. Or at least that was the idea. His first two years in the league were disappointing. He mostly shot 3 pointers, and wasn't especially good at it. As a point guard, he was tentative, and seemed to check out mentally at times when things were going bad (a frequent occurence on the woeful Jazz.)</p>
<p>This year, he's more of an all-around scorer, and much more efficient. He's scoring almost 6 more points per 36 minutes, while only taking 1.7 more shot attempts. A lot of that is driven by getting more free throws -- 3 more made free throws per 36 over last season. He's a threat to score from just about everywhere, after two seasons of not being a threat anywhere.</p>
<p>Keyonte's still bad on defense. The Jazz are 28th in Defensive Rating, so like Kyshawn, it's awfully hard to say how good he really is when he plays on such a crappy team. His game is similar to DeAaron Fox, who is currently thriving on the Spurs surrounded by significantly above average defenders. So I think he has a bright future even if he never makes a big leap on defense.</p>
<h2>7'6" man kills giant</h2>
<p>Shout out to the try-hard Spurs for taking down the Thunder in the NBA cup. The fact that the tallest guy in the NBA took down basketball Goliath is perfect. No notes. My biggest basketball fear is that if the aliens come down and challenge Earth to a game, we're not gonna have anyone who can guard Wemby.</p>
<h2>Mathletix Bajillion, week I guess we're still doing this</h2>
<p>As usual, one of these teams picks randomly, the other algorithmically.</p>
<p>The Ringer went 9-16 on the week, for a 171-204 combined record on the season and 45.6% winning percentage. The mathletix teams didn't cover themselves in glory either, going 3-7. Nobody knows nothin'. All of us are in the gutter, but some of us are staring at the reduced juice.</p>

<p>Notebook: <a href="https://github.com/csdurfee/csdurfee.github.io/blob/main/notebooks/free-throws.ipynb">https://github.com/csdurfee/csdurfee.github.io/blob/main/notebooks/free-throws.ipynb</a></p>
<h2>The Bucks</h2>
<p>There's a lot of buzz around the Milwaukee Bucks right now because their star player has asked to be traded, but I'm gonna stick to the math. The NBA take-industrial complex has got the Giannis situation covered, and I do math better than drama.</p>
<p>I noted a few weeks ago that the Bucks make a surprisingly low number of free throws given that they have a guy with one of the highest free throw rates in the league. They're also bad on defense and end up fouling a lot. That's a bad combination.</p>
<p>As of December 5th, the Bucks are dead last in free throws made (14.4 per game) and 6th worst in free throws made by the other team (21.3 per game). Aren't they essentially having to play every game with a 6.9 point handicap? </p>
<p>Although it's an intuitively simple way of looking at things, it's too simple. Basketball strategy is a series of tradeoffs. There are a lot of "good" numbers -- stats that correlate with more wins -- but it's usually hard to make one <em>good</em> number go up without a <em>bad</em> number going up, or another <em>good</em> number going down, in response.</p>
<p>I'm looking at the last 25 years of team data from nba.com/stats.</p>
<h2>Things to remember about free throws</h2>
<p>There are complications to analyzing free throws because they're not a fixed quantity. Some fans will see a game where one team gets 20 free throws and the other team gets 35, and take it as evidence that the refs were biased. That's naive -- some players/teams foul more on defense, some players/teams take more <em>foul-worthy</em> shots on on offense, and there's plenty of random variation form game to game. It would be weird if every team committed exactly 30 fouls every single game.</p>
<p>There's seasonality to foul calls as well. On top of formal rule changes, the NBA issues <em>points of emphasis</em> for its officials each year, which change how the rules are interpreted. Certain types of fouls may be emphasized, or de-emphasized, causing the total number of fouls called to go up or down. It's hard to find a formal record of these de facto rule changes, but as a fan, I've seen it several times. For instance, <a href="/overs-money-lines-and-pigeonholes.html">I previously talked about</a> the middle of the 2023 season, where the league told officials to stop calling so many fouls in general, without telling teams or the general public. </p>
<p>There was another shift in the early 2010's where the officials quit calling so many fouls caused by the actions of the shooter rather than the defender. A shooter can shoot in a somewhat artificial way to ensnare the defender's arms. This type of grifting still exists in the league -- looking at you, James Harden -- but the league reduced the number of cheap fouls called in the early 2010's. I couldn't find exactly when they formally made the proclamation, but we can see a big shift in the free throw data after the 2010-11 season.</p>
<p><img alt="/img/made-ft.png" src="/img/made-ft.png"></p>
<p>The current season has been more like the NBA from 2004-2010, at over 39 made free throws a game. However, there's a lot more scoring now, so free throws are a smaller percentage of a team's total points:</p>
<p><img alt="/img/points-off-ft.png" src="/img/points-off-ft.png"></p>
<h2>Do free throw differentials matter?</h2>
<p>Of course, there's going to be a lot more variance in the 20 games of this season when compared to a full 82 games.</p>
<p>The Bucks' free throw differential of -6.9 (<em>not nice</em>) would be by far the worst of the last 25 years, if it held for the whole season. The Celtics' current differential of -6.3 also stands out. </p>
<p>90% of NBA seasons are between the two white lines. We'd expect there to be 3 outliers by the end of the season, instead of 7.</p>
<p><img alt="/img/ft-diff-season.png" src="/img/ft-diff-season.png"></p>
<p>Some of the differential is due to chance. We should charitably assume that referees make random errors when calling or not calling fouls. Refs can make both Type I errors (fouls they shouldn't have called) and Type II errors (fouls they should have called and missed). Some teams will get called for more fouls than other teams, due to randomness, rather than conspiracy. Over a larger sample size, the refereeing luck will even out.</p>
<p>Free throw differential is positively correlated with winning.</p>
<p><img alt="/img/ftm-diff-win-pct.png" src="/img/ftm-diff-win-pct.png"></p>
<p>The diagonal line is the overall trendline. Even though it's a positive trend, the teams with some of the biggest positive and negative differentials are close to .500 win percentage. This is a good example of why it's important to visualize data, not just look at the correlation. The bigger picture shows it's good to have a positive free throw point differential, but not a magic ticket to winning.</p>
<h2>Do referees try to keep fouls roughly even?</h2>
<p>It's possible referees have an unconscious bias towards calling an even number of fouls on both teams. There's certainly a correlation between more free throws made and more free throws given up to the other team.</p>
<p><img alt="/img/ftm-vs-opponent.png" src="/img/ftm-vs-opponent.png"></p>
<p>However, this overall picture is misleading. The number of fouls called per game goes up and down season-to-season based on rule changes and <em>points of emphasis</em>. So from year to year, the center of all the dots should move up and down along the diagonal line <code>FTM=Opponent FTM</code>. We should expect a positive correlation overall that isn't necessarily there in the individual seasons -- an example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_paradox">Simpson's paradox</a>.</p>
<p>Here's an animation of the correlations year-by-year:</p>
<p><img alt="/img/ftm-scatter.gif" src="/img/ftm-scatter.gif"></p>
<p>A lot of seasons, the trendline is basically flat. But plotting correlations year by year, there are a lot more positive years than negative.</p>
<p><img alt="/img/corr-ftm.png" src="/img/corr-ftm.png"></p>
<p>So I do think it's possible that refs call more fouls on teams that get fouled a lot, a conscious or subconscious bias towards <em>fairness</em>. Or perhaps, teams that play physical on offense also tend to play physical on defense as well. We'd need to look at individual games -- we're not going to see evidence of that in the yearly averages.</p>
<h2>Basketball strategy and opportunity cost</h2>
<p>The opponent's number of free throws made has a higher correlation with winning percentage (<code>r=-0.260</code>) than a team's number of free throws made (<code>r=0.153</code>). If it were possible to make such a binary tradeoff, the Bucks would be better off trying to foul the other team less, rather than trying to draw more fouls. That's especially true given the Bucks are the best 3 point shooting team in the league -- drawing more fouls would mean fewer 3 point attempts. They have the 2nd highest eFG%, so they're already making the most of their shot attempts. </p>
<p>Why isn't their offense better overall? One big reason is their offensive rebounding rate is the lowest in the league. They score the fewest 2nd chance points in the league, at only 10.5 2nd chance points a game, versus 18 a game for the top teams. Does that mean another de facto 7 point handicap?</p>
<p>Not necessarily, because offensive rebounding rate is a schematic choice. Do the bigs try to get the rebound (<em>crash the boards</em>), or do they try to hustle back and play defense? Teams coached by Doc Rivers tend to have low offensive rebounding rates. The "Lob City" Clippers were a great rebounding team, yet in their heyday from 2014-2018, they were 21st, 28th, 29th, and 24th in offensive rebounding, so it's not surprising the Bucks have that same tendency.</p>
<p>The Thunder have the 3rd fewest second chance points, so a team can definitely be elite and not get a lot of offensive rebounds. But unlike the Thunder, the Bucks are bad on defense (22nd in defensive rating) and foul way too much, so they're not in a good place to make defense their identity. If this were NBA 2K, I'd probably move the "crash the boards" slider to the left for the Bucks and see what happens, because the Bucks are closer to being elite on the offensive end. There's more strength to build on.</p>
<p>There is only a very slight positive correlation between 2nd chance point differential and winning percentage. It's a bad predictor of team success.</p>

<h2>The Nets are fun... for now</h2>
<p>The Brooklyn Nets had a bunch of draft picks and cap space going into this offseason, and they didn't seem to maximize those resources. A lot of people didn't like the trade they made for Michael Porter Jr., which got the Denver Nuggets out of salary cap hell in exchange for a fairly small return. The Nets were the only team in the league with the financial flexibility to take on bad contracts in trades, so they probably could have gotten more.</p>
<p>They also didn't trade any of the five first round picks they accumulated in this year's draft. Why didn't they trade some of them for future picks? The conventional wisdom is that teams shouldn't try to develop too many rookies at once. What's a team supposed to do with five rookies (two of whom are teenagers), with some overlap in the positions they play?</p>
<p>Well for one thing, they're supposed to be terrible. The Nets have been bottoming out for a few seasons, and I doubt that will stop this season. Catch them in the next few weeks while they're sort of trying to win games, if you're curious. They've won 3 out of their last 4 games and they've been entertaining.</p>
<p>They were fun for a few weeks at this point in the season last year, too. The front office will probably try to trade away their best players over the next couple of months to keep them from being too good. But right now, MPJ is a good stats/bad team All-Star, Nic Claxton is solid as always, rookie Danny Wolf is already a fan favorite, and a couple other rookies show promise. </p>
<p>As fun as they are, I'm not encouraged by the Nets' approach to rebuilding. I'm always a lot more concerned with process than outcomes, because the process can be controlled. It seems like their idea is that if they draft enough first rounders, inevitably some of them will be good. It's treating players like lotto scratch tickets -- players are inherently winners or losers, and it's the front office's job to play the percentages and get as many picks as possible.</p>
<p>That's bad process to me. Players are more like a packet of seeds. The final result is heavily dependent on how and where they are grown. The same seed grown in two different environments can give two very different results. Some seeds are better than others, but without the right environment, even the best seeds won't grow to their maximum potential. I don't know if they have the culture and support system to develop their five rookies. It will be a few years before we'll see what sort of trees they're growing in Brooklyn.</p>
<h2>The Mathletix Bajillion, week whatever</h2>
<p>As usual, one set of NFL picks is algorithmic, the other is random. </p>
<p>Mathletix won the week, with a total record of 6-4 versus the Ringer's 10-15 record (note: their website incorrectly lists <em>The Handicapos</em> as going 5-0 when they actually went 4-1. I'm petty enough to notice, but not petty enough to email them about it.)  </p>
<p>The Ringer currently has 3 teams at 33-37 and 2 teams at 31-39, for a cumulative record of 161-189 (46.0% winning rate). Of course, some of the Ringer's picks contradict each other -- one Ringer team taking the home team, and another taking the away team on the same game. Removing the bets where Ringer teams contradicted each other would just make things worse, though, because taking both sides of a bet has a winning percentage of 50%, which is better than the Ringer's overall win rate.</p>
<p>Someone taking the opposite of every one of the Ringer experts' picks would be up 11.9 units on the year, for a +3.4% rate of return. There's only a 6.7% chance of getting results that bad by flipping a coin. </p>
<p>As I've written about before, I don't think that makes them bad as far as gambling experts go. Rather, I believe everything they know about football has already been incorporated into the line, so their knowledge is kind of a curse -- they're overvaluing information that the market has already absorbed, so they end up losing more than 50% of the time.</p>

<p>Song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6L1mD-tgoE4" target="_blank">Hobo Johnson, "Sacramento Kings Anthem (we’re not that bad)"</a></p>
<p><em>Stats are as of 12/1/2025</em>. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rHkNoaj3lX5eEGQQ3NwpXtwajKTUYOhUecpoYItPL2M/edit?usp=sharing.">Spreadsheet here</a></p>
<h2>The Kings</h2>
<p>The Sacramento Kings are going through it. Again. For most other teams, the choices they've made recently would be a historically incompetent period, a basketball Dark Ages. For the Kings, it's just another season. </p>
<p>Firing the only coach that's had success with the team in a long time and replacing him with a buddy of the owner who is willing to work cheap. Drafting two All-Star point guards and trading both of them away. Trading for two guys (LaVine and DeRozan) who everybody knew would be a bad fit from their years playing together on the Bulls. Trading the very good, ultra reliable Jonas Valančiūnas for the washed Dario Saric just to save a tiny bit of money.</p>
<p>Do you know the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKMMCPeiQoc">definition of insanity</a>? The Kings' front office doesn't.</p>
<p>Sacramento is 5-16 so far. They're definitely not a good team, but maybe they're <em>not that bad</em>? They went 40-42 last season, which is respectable in the loaded Western Conference. They've had a brutally hard schedule, and 21 games is not a large sample size. </p>
<p>I'll get back to the Kings, but first, the other side of the coin.</p>
<h2>The Heat</h2>
<p>The Miami Heat were arguably in a worse place than the Kings at the end of last season. They won 37 games, 3 fewer than the Kings, and play in the easier conference. They looked totally checked out by the end of the season, another team stuck in the middle of the NBA standings.</p>
<p>It was a disappointing, dysfunctional run where they <a href="/free-throw-merchants-and-the-value-of-stars.html">traded away their best player</a> and seemed to be going nowhere. The vibes were bad, but they didn't blow up the team for the hope of maybe being good again someday, or run back the same players and the same scheme for another bout of mediocrity. Instead, they trusted the culture they built and tried something innovative.</p>
<p>They've been one of the best stories in the NBA so far, greatly outperforming expectations by playing a radical brand of basketball on the offensive end. They completely overhauled their offense to quickly attack one-on-one matchups before the defense can get set, rather than the traditional approach of creating mismatches using pick-and-rolls. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVBsWm7uhGw">Here's a good video from Thinking Basketball explaining the strategy</a>, an even more turbo-charged version of the scheme the Grizzlies used to great success last year. As a basketball fan, it's a bit weird to watch at first, because pick and rolls are such an traditional part of basketball, but it's refreshing.</p>
<p>I don't know why more teams don't have the courage to try unconventional things  -- <a href="/home-of-elvis-and-the-ancient-greeks.html">or in the Grizzlies' case, stick with something unconventional that was working.</a> In the NBA, it takes a great coach and front office to defy the conventional wisdom and try to get more out of the players already on the roster -- putting them in a position to succeed rather than re-shuffling the deck.</p>
<p>The most remarkable part is that overhauling the offense hasn't sacrificed the Heat's identity as a top-tier defensive team at all. They have the 4th best defense in the league so far by Defensive Rating. They're doing this while playing at the fastest pace in the league this year. Teams that play fast are usually just trying to outscore their opponents, with little attention to defense. </p>
<p>But the Heat are using their scheme to generate high quality offensive opportunities for players that are primarily on the court for their defense. They're building on their core identity rather than changing directions entirely. They're building on strength.</p>
<p>An elite playmaker like Tyrese Halliburton, or a generational talent like SGA or Jokic, can set up defense-first players for easy looks, but most teams that concentrate on defense struggle generating enough offensive firepower. The Orlando Magic have been plagued by that problem for years. The system Miami is running seems like a cheat code for defensively minded teams -- at least until the league inevitably figures out ways to slow it down.</p>
<p>I couldn't find anybody in the media who knew the Heat's scheme change was coming, much less an idea of how much of an impact it would have.  I looked at a bunch of preseason power rankings, and they were all pretty down on the Heat for the same reasons, without any hint that they could fix the problems with a different play style. It's much easier to assess the impact of roster changes.</p>
<p>For example, this is from <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/nba-power-rankings-2025-26-where-do-teams-stand-after-nba-offseason-rockets-nuggets-chase-thunder-at-top">NBC Sports'</a> preseason power rankings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this was a middle-of-the-pack Heat team last season that made no bold moves, no massive upgrades, leaving them in the same spot they were a year ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25253509-nba-power-rankings-entering-2025-preseason">Bleacher Report's</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>for an offensively challenged team, replacing [Tyler Herro's] scoring (21.5 points over the last four seasons) and distribution (4.6 assists in the same span) is going to be tough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2025/09/30/nba-power-rankings-training-camps/86421865007/">USA Today's</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Losing Tyler Herro for the first two months of the season, potentially, comes as a significant blow to a team that struggled to score — especially late in games — even when he was on the floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the change in style the Heat are still only a mid-tier team on offense, ranking 14th in Offensive Rating. But that's a big step up from last year, when they were 21st, especially given they haven't had their best offensive player for the first month of the season.</p>
<p>Are they going to win a title with the present roster? No, but in addition to giving their fans something to cheer for, all their players will look much better on paper than they did at the start of this season. If they do decide to trade players, the Heat can get more in return for them. And it's not hard to get free agents to move to Miami if the team is winning and the vibes are good, so they could be a real contender again quickly. </p>
<p>It's weird that tanking is seen as the best way to increase the chances of future success in the NBA, rather than building a winning culture and innovating. The two teams with the most success in recent years at doing a major rebuild have been the Spurs and the Thunder. They were both bad for a few years, but they're also two of the best run teams in the league. They draft well, they trade well, they do player development well, they do analytics well. They had a clear vision of the type of team they wanted to build and the clear ability to develop players. If a team doesn't have those organizational competencies, what's the point of a tank? They're just going to waste their high-level draft picks, not develop the rest of the roster, and be mediocre again in 5 years.</p>
<h2>Power ranking the power rankers</h2>
<p>I collected data from six preseason NBA power rankings. There's a link to the spreadsheet at the top of the article. I would've liked to collect more data, and I'm sure there are other sites that did good NBA power rankings, but stuff like that is basically impossible to find these days, lost in a sea of completely LLM generated baloney or locked behind paywalls. It's not useful interrogating why some LLM <em>stochastically decided</em> that the Warriors are the 4th best team in the NBA this year, but there's seemingly an endless supply of that type of nonsense. Which is to say: thanks for reading this, however you managed to get here. I hope you'll keep coming back for this completely human generated baloney. </p>
<p>I compared the rankings from each list to each team's point differential, which is a better estimate of how good a team is than their win-loss record. How good were our mighty morphin' power rankers at predicting the current standings? </p>
<p>So far, the most accurate ranking has been <a href="https://www.rotoballer.com/rss-slideshow/nba-preseason-power-rankings-every-team-from-worst-to-first">RotoBaller's</a>, with a Spearman correlation of .76. The worst has been USA Today, at .69. Taking the median rank of all six sources produced a correlation of .74, which was better than 5 out of the 6 individual scores. So we're getting a "wisdom of crowds" effect, which is interesting, since all the rankings are fairly similar to each other. <a href="/majority-voting-in-ensemble-learning.html">(Previously discussed in <em>Majority voting in ensemble learning</em>.)</a></p>
<p>I also included rankings based on my own preseason win total estimates. I got a score of .73, right in the middle of the pack. That's respectable, but I can't believe I'm getting beat by the freaking New York Post.</p>
<p>Comparing rankings to records, the power rankers were too high on the Clippers, Cavaliers, Pacers, Kings and Warriors. They were too low on the Raptors, Suns, Heat, Spurs and Pistons.</p>
<h2>Strength of schedule</h2>
<p>Scheduling matters. Some teams have played much harder schedules than others, and we're dealing with small sample sizes, so win-loss records can be deceiving early in the season.</p>
<p>I grabbed adjusted Net Rating (aNET) data from <a href="https://dunksandthrees.com/stats/team">dunksandthrees</a>, which calculates the offensive and defensive ratings for each team, adjusted for strength of schedule. I also included Simple Rating System (SRS) data from <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2025.html">basketball-reference</a>, which is the same idea as aNET, but a different methodology.</p>
<p>The difference between aNET and average point differential gives a sense of which team records might be the most misleading compared to the team's actual skill level. For instance, the Sacramento Kings have already played the Thunder, Nuggets and Timberwolves three times apiece, going 2-7 over those games. Even a decent team would be expected to have a losing record against those opponents.</p>
<p>Based on aNET, the Cavaliers, Warriors, Clippers, Kings and Celtics are probably better than their records indicate.</p>
<p>Going the other way, the Raptors have had a deceptively easy schedule, going 7-1 in games against the woeful Nets, Hornets, Pacers and Wizards. Going 7-1 doesn't tell us much, because those are teams pretty much everybody should be able to beat. </p>
<p>The stats indicate that the Raptors, Hornets, Spurs, Jazz, and Suns are probably not as good as their records.</p>
<p>Most of the teams the power rankers got wrong have been hurt or helped significantly by their schedules so far. The biggest exception has been the Miami Heat, who apparently nobody saw coming, and are probably about as good as their record says they are.</p>
<h2>The Kangz</h2>
<p>What to make of the Kings? According to basketball-reference, they've had the hardest schedule in the league so far. It's fair to say they're not as bad as the record says.</p>
<p>While they're 28th in point differential, they're 25th by aNET, and 26th by SRS. So they might have 7 or 8 wins instead of 5 if they'd played a league average schedule. That's not that much, though, and a clear step back from last year.</p>
<p>Their rookie, Nique Clifford, has not looked good so far, and they don't have many players that other teams would want in a trade. It doesn't seem like they have any clue of how to develop young talent. Their highest paid player, Zach LaVine, has another year on his contract, doesn't play defense, and has put up a -1.1 VORP this year. They just benched their one big signing of the offseason (Dennis Schröder), and are instead starting Russell Westbrook, a man born during the Reagan Administration playing on a one year minimum deal.</p>
<p>On paper, they don't have much they can do to get better.  But everybody was saying that about the Heat at the end of last year, and look at them now. I just can't see the Kings having that type of organizational courage, but I hope they find it somehow rather than spend years on another doomed rebuild. Sacramento fans deserve better than another version of the current mess. At least an innovative mess would be a change of pace from trying the same stupid thing over and over. What's the worst that could happen?</p>
<p>Sacramento's roster isn't great, but <a href="/home-of-elvis-and-the-ancient-greeks.html">like the Grizzlies</a>, the biggest problems I see are organizational. I understand the Kings are a rich man's toy, not a serious basketball team, but wouldn't it be more fun to own a team that <em>wasn't</em> a giant tire fire? I don't get spending billions of dollars to buy a sports team just to run it into the ground like this.</p>
<h2>The Mathletix Bajillion, week 5</h2>
<p>As usual: One of these teams picks NFL games randomly, the other uses a simple algorithm. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/topic/ringer-107">4 of 5 Ringer 107 teams had a losing week</a>, going 10-15 collectively. All five still have a losing record on the season, so right now the McAul-Stars are the undisputed leaders.</p>
<p>Bluster aside, the important thing to notice is how much they're saving taking cheaper lines than the standard -110 odds. The McAul-Stars would be up +110 instead of +176 if the bets were taken at a retail sportsbook, and the Hand-Eggs would be down -620 instead of -563.</p>

<h3>Jimmy Butler: still good</h3>
<p>Last season, Jimmy Butler quiet quit on his team. He wanted a new contract from the Miami Heat, and they didn't want to give him one, so he just stopped trying. As a fan, it seemed like an annoying and entitled thing to do. He couldn't just play the season out?</p>
<p>Butler eventually ended up getting traded to the Golden State Warriors, who gave him the extension he wanted, and he started trying again. </p>
<p>Setting aside whether Butler was justified, was the extension worth it or not? Butler is 36 years old, an age where it's totally expected for players to start to decline. The NBA salary cap rules now make it so a team can't afford to get a contract as big as Butler's wrong.</p>
<p>The Warriors took a calculated risk, and it paid immediate dividends when Jimmy helped them sneak into the playoffs last year, but the team is about in the same position they were before they got him -- a few high level players, but not in the upper echelon of the league due being old and incomplete.</p>
<p>Jimmy's doing great, though. He's at career highs in True Shooting (TS%) and effective FG percent (eFG%). </p>
<p><img alt="/img/jimmy-efg.png" src="/img/jimmy-efg.png"></p>
<p>He's always been an efficient scorer, due to his ability to draw a lot of fouls. That means shooting a lot of free throws, which are easy points. Jimmy has been getting about 2.4x the number of free throws per shot attempt compared to the league average.</p>
<p>That's about where he's been for several seasons now. His free throw rate saw a huge jump when he moved to the Miami Heat in the 2019-2020 season, and he's maintained that ever since:</p>
<p><img alt="/img/jimmy-ftr.png" src="/img/jimmy-ftr.png"></p>
<p>The career highs in TS% and eFG% probably aren't sustainable, though. Butler's a career 33% 3 point shooter who's making 45% of them this season. I wouldn't bet on that continuing, but he'll always be valuable on offense if he can draw that many free throws.</p>
<p>Butler's defense is still great, as well. The Warriors are 6.5 points per 100 possessions better on defense when he's on the floor.</p>
<p>He stands out on all the advanced metrics. Right now, he's 4th in WS/48 (behind Jokic, Shai and Giannis), 8th in PER, 8th in VORP, 3rd in Offensive Rating, 8th in Box Plus/Minus, and 11th in <a href="https://dunksandthrees.com/epm/actual">EPM</a>.</p>
<p>For the numbers he's putting up, I think he's worth the money.</p>
<h3>Ewing theory, 2025 edition</h3>
<p>Individuals don't win games, teams do. Sometimes it can be hard to tell how much of player's individual contribution is actually increasing the likelihood of their team winning. And there's always opportunity cost: perhaps a big man would've been more valuable to this team than Butler has been.</p>
<p>When a star player gets injured, sometimes a team plays better, a phenomenon Bill Simmons coined "The Ewing Theory". We're seeing some of that this year.</p>
<p>The Atlanta Hawks are 2-3 this season when star Trae Young plays, and 9-4 when he doesn't.</p>
<p>The Memphis Grizzlies are 4-8 when star Ja Morant plays, and 2-4 when he doesn't. (While the win percentage is the same, the team has looked less hapless in those 6 games.)</p>
<p>The Orlando Magic are 6-6 when star Paolo Banchero plays, and 4-2 when he doesn't.</p>
<p>All three players have distinctive play styles that their team must run to maximize their talents -- to paraphrase James Harden, they are the system. Sometimes maximizing the opportunities for the best player means wasting some of the talents of the other players on the team.</p>
<p>Similar distinctive players like Harden, Jokic and Halliburton are far more essential -- their teams are much worse when they are out, despite the same potential on paper for holding their teams back.</p>
<p>What's the difference between the Hawks, who have been doing better without Trae Young, and the Pacers, who are completely hapless without Tyrese Halliburton? I'm not going to read too much into such small sample sizes, but it's an interesting thing to watch out for.</p>
<h3>SGA's FTAs</h3>
<p>Debates involving subjects anybody can have an opinion about tend to be much louder than subjects requiring specialized knowledge. It's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">law of triviality</a>. The purest form of this in sports is the question of who is the most valuable player. TThe NBA version of this debate is probably the loudest and least interesting of any sport.</p>
<p>There are people who don't know much about basketball or statistics, but will argue endlessly on the internet whether BPM or EPM or RAPTOR or VORP is the right metric for deciding who is the best player. Or rather, they decide on the player they like, then find the statistic that says what they want to hear.</p>
<p>For me, the MVP usually comes down to personal preference -- there are always a handful of players that are clearly better than everybody else, and which one is the most valuable among that set is a matter of taste, and often gets decided by narratives rather than anything rigorous. Perhaps rigor is futile. Pretty much every MVP caliber player is a unique basketball talent. None of them are really interchangeable -- they all break the mold in some way. Any sort of all-in-one number is bound to fail at capturing what makes each one special.</p>
<p>Perhaps because it is a matter of taste and ultimately a very trivial question, people tend to latch onto style points. Who is funnest to watch, who would be the funnest to play with. Who scores points <em>ethically</em> and <em>unethically</em>.</p>
<p>People who think that Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (SGA) shouldn't be the MVP derisively call him <em>FTA</em>, implying he gets awarded more free throws than he deserves, or is otherwise a free throw merchant -- someone who baits defenders into fouling him.</p>
<p>Shai is currently currently the leader in FTAs this year, so the <em>FTA</em> nickname is accurate in one sense. Here are the 10 players with the most free throw attempts this season, plus Jokić (15th place.)</p>

<p>Shai's FTr+ of 164 indicates he gets 1.64x more free throws per shot attempt than the average player.</p>
<p>In a vacuum, that seems high, but everybody on this list has an FTr+ of over 100. They're all good at drawing fouls. Most high volume scorers are. They score a lot and get fouled a lot for the same reason, they're hard to guard. Jimmy Butler is the king, though -- the only player on the list averaging under 20 points a game, and the only one with an FTr over .600. </p>
<p>Jimmy's getting 2 free throws per every 3 shots he attempts. Since he makes 80% of them, that's a free half point Butler gets every time he attempts a shot. As far as free throw merchants go, he's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_di_Bicci_de%27_Medici">Giovanni de' Medici</a>.</p>
<p>Compared to his peers, SGA's free throw rate is pretty tame. It's 7th on this list -- lower than Luka Dončić, Deni Avdija, James Harden, Franz Wagner, Giannis, and Jimmy Butler.</p>
<p>It's a little higher than Jokić's, but I don't know how you decide that an FTr+ of 139 is ethical, but an FTr+ of 164 is unethical (or a sign that the refs are in the tank for SGA). Where's the line? Why do other MVP candidates like Luka and Giannis escape criticism, when they draw more fouls per shot than SGA does?</p>
<p>I'll take a deeper dive into the topic some other time, but the fact that Luka's free throw rate took a jump when he got traded to the Lakers is another example of why the NBA stands for Not Beating Allegations.</p>
<h2>Mathletix Bajillion, week 4</h2>
<p>As usual: one team picks randomly, one team uses a simple algorithm. </p>
<p>Both the mathletix teams have losing records now, but so do all 5 Ringer teams, so it's still anyone's game. We're still saving a lot of (imaginary) money by shopping for lines, instead of taking them at -110. Even though I got lazy with shopping, I still managed to find all 10 bets at reduced juice.</p>
