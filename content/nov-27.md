### Jimmy Butler: still good
Last season, Jimmy Butler quiet quit on his team. He wanted a new contract from the Miami Heat, and they didn't want to give him one, so he just stopped trying. As a fan, it seemed like an annoying and entitled thing to do. He couldn't just play the season out?

Butler eventually ended up getting traded to the Golden State Warriors, who gave him the extension he wanted, and he started trying again. 

Setting aside whether Butler was justified, was the extension worth it or not? Butler is 36 years old, an age where it's totally expected for players to start to decline. The NBA salary cap rules now make it so a team can't afford to get a contract as big as Butler's wrong.

The Warriors took a calculated risk, and it paid immediate dividends when Jimmy helped them sneak into the playoffs last year, but the team is about in the same position they were before they got him -- a few high level players, but not in the upper echelon of the league due being old and incomplete.

Jimmy's doing great, though. He's at career highs in True Shooting (TS%) and effective FG percent (eFG%).

He's always been an efficient scorer, due to his ability to draw a lot of fouls. That means shooting a lot of free throws, which are easy points. Jimmy has been getting about 2.4x the number of free throws per shot attempt compared to the league average.

That's about where he's been for several seasons now. His free throw rate saw a huge jump when he moved to the Miami Heat in the 2019-2020 season, and he's maintained that ever since:

The career highs in TS% and eFG% probably aren't sustainable, though. Butler's a career 33% 3 point shooter who's making 45% of them this season. I wouldn't bet on that continuing, but he'll always be valuable on offense if he can draw that many free throws.

Butler's defense is still great, as well. The Warriors are 6.5 points per 100 possessions better on defense when he's on the floor.

He stands out on all the advanced metrics. Right now, he's 4th in WS/48 (behind Jokic, Shai and Giannis), 8th in PER, 8th in VORP, 3rd in Offensive Rating, 8th in Box Plus/Minus, and 11th in [EPM](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm/actual).

For the numbers he's putting up, I think he's worth the money.

### Ewing theory, 2025 edition
Individuals don't win games, teams do. Sometimes it can be hard to tell how much of player's individual contribution is actually increasing the likelihood of their team winning. And there's always opportunity cost: perhaps a big man would've been more valuable to this team than Butler has been.

When a star player gets injured, sometimes a team plays better, a phenomenon Bill Simmons coined "The Ewing Theory". We're seeing some of that this year.

The Atlanta Hawks are 2-3 this season when star Trae Young plays, and 9-4 when he doesn't.

The Memphis Grizzlies are 4-8 when star Ja Morant plays, and 2-4 when he doesn't. (While the win percentage is the same, the team has looked less hapless in those 6 games.)

The Orlando Magic are 6-6 when star Paolo Banchero plays, and 4-2 when he doesn't.

All three players have distinctive play styles that their team must run to maximize their talents -- to paraphrase James Harden, they are the system. Sometimes maximizing the opportunities for the best player means wasting some of the talents of the other players on the team.

Similar distinctive players like Harden, Jokic and Halliburton are far more essential -- their teams are much worse when they are out, despite the same potential on paper for holding their teams back.

What's the difference between the Hawks, who have been doing better without Trae Young, and the Pacers, who are completely hapless without Tyrese Halliburton? I'm not going to read too much into such small sample sizes, but it's an interesting thing to watch out for.

### SGA's FTAs
Debates involving subjects anybody can have an opinion about tend to be much louder than subjects requiring specialized knowledge. It's the [law of triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality). The purest form of this in sports is the question of who is the most valuable player. TThe NBA version of this debate is probably the loudest and least interesting of any sport.

There are people who don't know much about basketball or statistics, but will argue endlessly on the internet whether BPM or EPM or RAPTOR or VORP is the right metric for deciding who is the best player. Or rather, they decide on the player they like, then find the statistic that says what they want to hear.

For me, the MVP usually comes down to personal preference -- there are always a handful of players that are clearly better than everybody else, and which one is the most valuable among that set is a matter of taste, and often gets decided by narratives rather than anything rigorous. Perhaps rigor is futile. Pretty much every MVP caliber player is a unique basketball talent. None of them are really interchangeable -- they all break the mold in some way. Any sort of all-in-one number is bound to fail at capturing what makes each one special.

Perhaps because it is a matter of taste and ultimately a very trivial question, people tend to latch onto style points. Who is funnest to watch, who would be the funnest to play with. Who scores points *ethically* and *unethically*.

People who think that Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (SGA) shouldn't be the MVP derisively call him *FTA*, implying he gets awarded more free throws than he deserves, or is otherwise a free throw merchant -- someone who baits defenders into fouling him.

Shai is currently currently the leader in FTAs this year, so the *FTA* nickname is accurate in one sense. Here are the 10 players with the most free throw attempts this season, plus Jokić (15th place.)

| Name                    |   Attempts |   FTr |   FTr+ |   PPG |
|:------------------------|-----------:|------:|-------:|------:|
| Shai Gilgeous-Alexander |        167 | 0.465 |    164 |  32.2 |
| Luka Dončić             |        150 | 0.551 |    194 |  34.5 |
| Deni Avdija             |        143 | 0.472 |    166 |  24.9 |
| Devin Booker            |        141 | 0.416 |    147 |  26.4 |
| James Harden            |        139 | 0.488 |    172 |  27.8 |
| Franz Wagner            |        136 | 0.471 |    166 |  23   |
| Giannis Antetokounmpo   |        132 | 0.532 |    188 |  31.2 |
| Jimmy Butler            |        132 | 0.667 |    235 |  19.9 |
| Pascal Siakam           |        130 | 0.444 |    156 |  24.8 |
| Tyrese Maxey            |        125 | 0.334 |    118 |  33   |
| Nikola Jokić            |        116 | 0.395 |    139 |  29.6 |

Shai's FTr+ of 164 indicates he gets 1.64x more free throws per shot attempt than the average player.

In a vacuum, that seems high, but everybody on this list has an FTr+ of over 100. They're all good at drawing fouls. Most high volume scorers are. They score a lot and get fouled a lot for the same reason, they're hard to guard. Jimmy Butler is the king, though -- the only player on the list averaging under 20 points a game, and the only one with an FTr over .600. 

Jimmy's getting 2 free throws per every 3 shots he attempts. Since he makes 80% of them, that's a free half point Butler gets every time he attempts a shot. As far as free throw merchants go, he's [Giovanni de' Medici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_di_Bicci_de%27_Medici).

Compared to his peers, SGA's free throw rate is pretty tame. It's 7th on this list -- lower than Luka Dončić, Deni Avdija, James Harden, Franz Wagner, Giannis, and Jimmy Butler.

It's a little higher than Jokić's, but I don't know how you decide that an FTr+ of 139 is ethical, but an FTr+ of 164 is unethical (or a sign that the refs are in the tank for SGA). Where's the line? Why do other MVP candidates like Luka and Giannis escape criticism, when they draw more fouls per shot than SGA does?

I'll take a deeper dive into the topic some other time, but the fact that Luka's free throw rate took a jump when he got traded to the Lakers is another example of why the NBA stands for Not Beating Allegations.

## Mathletix Bajillion, week 4
As usual: one team picks randomly, one team uses a simple algorithm. 

Both the mathletix teams have losing records now, but so do all 5 Ringer teams, so it's still anyone's game. We're still saving a lot of (imaginary) money by shopping for lines, instead of taking them at -110. Even though I got lazy with shopping, I still managed to find all 10 bets at reduced juice.

Lines as of Friday morning.
