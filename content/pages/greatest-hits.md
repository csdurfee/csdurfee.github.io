## The hot hand in the NBA
Read the full investigation: [https://mathletix.net/tag/the-hot-hand.html](https://mathletix.net/tag/the-hot-hand.html)

The "hot hand" doesn't exist for field goal attempts in NBA basketball. In fact, NBA players are significantly less streaky than they should be. This unstreakiness is mostly due to shot selection. For NBA players, their shooting percentage by type of shot doesn't change much based on how well they've been shooting lately -- there is definitely no hot hand in that sense. A player who has made 4 or 5 out of the last 5 shots isn't significantly more likely than average to make the next one, controlling for shot difficulty. 

While FG% by type of shot doesn't change, shot selection does -- on average, NBA players take higher percentage shots when they've been shooting poorly recently (they *go get a bucket*), and lower percentage shots when they're shooting well (they take a *heat check*). These *heat check* shots tend to be more inefficient shots as well (lower expected value), so this behavior definitely costs teams points, and possibly wins.

The real world is far streakier than our brains are equipped to deal with. Players believe they are streaky, which causes them to be less streaky than they would be by chance. Even though they're not as streaky as they should be,  NBA players still seem streaky to people who watch basketball, myself included. Our brains attach far too much meaning to streaks, and are really bad at intuitively understanding randomness.
