Nothing this week, as I'm working on a couple big things about the NFL.

# Mathletix Bajillion, see you next year edition
One mathletix team picks bets randomly, the other algorithmically.

Both teams took Washington +7, which ended up being a push. The line closed at +9, so they both missed out on a win by taking the bet early in the week. The Mcaul-Stars also lost the bet on JAX -6.5, who won by 6 points. The closing line was JAX -4. So they could've been 3-2 on the week, instead of 1-3-1.

Both games are good examples of the fact that closing lines aren't necessarily more accurate than the opening lines, [something I've covered before](/last-fair-deal-in-the-country.html). Of course, bettors taking the opposite side of Washington and Jacksonville would've been better off taking the lines early in the week. Whether line moves hurt or help will depend on which side of the line the gambler is on.

*Lines taken Thursday morning.*
