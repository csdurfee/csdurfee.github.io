### What's going on with the Grizzlies?

The easiest answer is they're miserably bad on offense. It's also the oddest thing about this team to me, since they scored effortlessly last year. The Grizzlies had found something that worked last season. They had the 6th best Offensive Rating, and 10th best Defensive Rating.  Considering the Indiana Pacers made it within one game of winning the NBA Championship with the 9th best Offensive Rating and 13th best Defensive Rating, the Grizzlies were definitely a borderline contender.

This year, they're 27th in Offensive Rating, 21 positions worse than last year. (The falloff on defense is a little more understandable, since they have several very good defensive players injured right now.)

eFG+ is a measure of effective FG%, normalized so that 100 is league average.  Here are the top 8 Grizzlies players by minutes played the last two seasons:

| Position   | 2025             | 2024              |   2025 eFG+ |   2024 eFG+ |   Diff |
|:-----------|:-----------------|:------------------|------------:|------------:|-------:|
| Center     | Jock Landale     | Zach Edey         |         108 |         111 |     -3 |
| PF         | Jaren Jackson Jr | Jaren Jackson Jr  |          98 |         101 |     -3 |
| SF         | Jaylen Wells     | Jaylen Wells      |          82 |          97 |    -15 |
| SG         | KCP              | Desmond Bane      |          77 |         104 |    -27 |
| PG         | Ja Morant        | Ja Morant         |          71 |          93 |    -22 |
| Bench 1    | Santi Aldama     | Santi Aldama      |          96 |         106 |    -10 |
| Bench 2    | Cedric Coward    | Scottie Pippen Jr |         105 |         102 |      3 |
| Bench 3    | Cam Spencer      | Brandon Clarke    |         109 |         115 |     -6 |

Except for rookie Cedric Coward, every single slot is a downgrade. Wells and Aldama have been significantly worse than last season, but the most dramatic is Ja Morant. The only player with around as many minutes played and a lower eFG+ are [Ben Sheppard](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/sheppbe01.html) and [Jarace Walker](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/walkeja02.html) of the Indiana Pacers, young players who have been forced into playing a lot of minutes due to injuries.

### Where have all the backup PGs gone?
A big problem for the Grizzlies is that they don't really have a backup point guard. They're far from the only team with a lack of PGs on the roster this season.

The Dallas Mavericks have been playing rookie forward Cooper Flagg as PG even though they knew their starting PG, Kyrie Irving, was injured coming into the season. The Nuggets have been experimenting with having forward Peyton Watson as backup PG. The Houston Rockets have no true PG in their "oops, all bigs" starting lineup, though Reed Sheppard is playing more and more off the bench, and looking pretty good.

It's an odd trend to me. Backup point guards have traditionally been cheap and easy to find -- guys like Ish Smith and D.J Augustin. They're like small, functional trucks. They made a ton of them back in the day, but they kinda don't exist anymore, despite how useful and reasonably priced they were. Does that make [Yuki Kawamura](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/k/kawamyu01.html) the [Kei truck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kei_truck) of this analogy? Yes, yes it does.

The Rockets and Nuggets are doing fine so far without playing a backup PG, but the Grizzlies' situation is just baffling to me. Ja Morant is one of the more injury prone players in the league. You didn't think you needed to find a real backup for him? (Wouldn't Russell Westbrook look good in a Grizzlies uniform?)

The Grizzlies have a stretch of easier opponents coming up, so I think they'll start looking a little better for that reason alone. Maybe they'll get some mojo back. But I'm always about process, rather than outcomes, and I just don't get the Grizzlies' process right now. They had something pretty cool going last year, and now they don't. 

Teams can't control a lot of factors. Injuries, who they play on a given night, the bounce of the ball on the rim on a last second shot. There's a lot of luck. But the Grizzlies' problems seem to come down to things the coaching staff and front office can control: vision, planning, vibes, communication, style of play.
